<h2 id="skill-9--to-forecast-weather">Skill 9- To forecast weather:</h2>

<p>Now to program your AI assistant to detect weather we need to generate an API key from Open Weather map.</p>

<p>Open weather map is an online service which provides weather data. By generating an API ID in the official website you can use the APP_ID to make your voice assistant detect weather of all places whenever required. The necessary modules needed to be imported for this weather detection is json and request module.</p>

<p>The <strong>city_name variabl</strong>e takes the command given by the human using the <strong>takeCommand()</strong> function.</p>

<p>The <strong>get</strong> method of <strong>request</strong> module returns a <strong>response</strong> object. And the <strong>json</strong> methods of response object converts json format data into python format.</p>

<p>The variable <strong>X</strong> contains list of nested dictionaries which checks whether the value of ‚ÄòCOD‚Äô is 404 or not that is if the city is found or not.</p>

<p>The values such as temperature and humidity is stored in the main key of variable <strong>Y</strong>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>elif "weather" in statement:
