<p>In this article, we will learn how to implement Azure serverless with Blazor web assembly. We will create an app that lists out some Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on Covid-19. We will create an Azure Cosmos DB which will act as our primary database to store questions and answers. An Azure function app will be used to fetch data from cosmos DB. We will deploy the function app to Azure to expose it globally via an API endpoint. We will consume the API in a Blazor web assembly app. The FAQs will be displayed in a card layout with the help of Bootstrap.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-serverless-architecture">What is a serverless architecture?</h2>

<p>In the traditional application such as a 3-tier app, a client will request the server for the resources, and the server will process the request and respond with the appropriate data.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ServerArchi.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>However, there are some issues with this architecture. We need a server running continuously. Even if there is no request, the server is present 24X7, ready to process the request. <strong>Maintaining server availability is cost-intensive</strong>.
Another problem is <strong>scaling</strong>. If the traffic is huge, we need to scale out all the servers and it can be a cumbersome process.</p>

<p>An effective solution to this problem is serverless web architecture. The client will make a request to a file storage account instead of a server. The storage account will return the <strong>index.html</strong> page along with some code that needs to be rendered on the browser. Since there is no server to render the page, we are relying on the browser to render the page. All the logic to draw the element or update the element will run in the browser. We do not have any server on backend, we just have a storage account with a static asset.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ServerLessArchi.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-azure-function">What is an Azure function?</h2>

<p>Making the browser run all the logic to render the page seems exciting but it has some limitations. We do not want the browser to make database calls. We need some part of our code to run on the server-side such as connecting to a database. This is the place when Azure functions come in use. In a serverless architecture, if we want some code to run the server-side, then we use an Azure function.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ServerLessArchiAZFunc.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Azure functions are event-driven serverless compute platform. You need to pay only when execution happens. They are also easy to scale. Hence, <strong>we get both the scaling and the cost benefits</strong> with Azure functions. To learn more refer to the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/functions/">Azure function official docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-use-azure-serverless">Why should you use Azure serverless?</h2>

<p>Azure serverless solution can add value to your product by minimizing the time and resources you spend on infrastructure-related requirements. You can increase the <strong>developer productivity</strong>, <strong>optimize resources</strong> and <strong>accelerate the time to market</strong> with the help of a fully managed, end-to-end Azure serverless solution.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-blazor">What is Blazor?</h2>

<p>Blazor is a .NET web framework for creating <strong>client-side applications</strong> using C#/Razor and HTML. Blazor runs in the browser with the help of WebAssembly. It can simplify the process of creating a single page application (SPA). It also provides a full-stack web development experience using .NET.</p>

<p>Using .NET for developing Client-side application has multiple advantages as mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.NET offers a range of API and tools across all platforms that are stable and easy to use.</li>
  <li>The modern languages such as C# and F# offer a lot of features that make programming easier and interesting for developers.</li>
  <li>The availability of one of the best IDE in the form of Visual Studio provides a great .NET development experience across multiple platforms such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
  <li>.NET provides features such as speed, performance, security, scalability, and reliability in web development that makes full-stack development easier.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-should-you-use-blazor">Why should you use Blazor?</h2>
<p>Blazor supports a wide array of features to make web development easier for us. Some of the prominent features of Blazor are mentioned below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Component-based architecture: Blazor provides us with a component-based architecture to create rich and composable UI.</li>
  <li>Dependency injection: This allows us to use services by injecting them into components.</li>
  <li>Layouts: We can share common UI elements (for example, menus) across pages using the layouts feature.</li>
  <li>Routing: We can redirect the client request from one component to another with the help of routing.</li>
  <li>JavaScript interop: This allows us to invoke a C# method from JavaScript, and we can call a JavaScript function or API from C# code.</li>
  <li>Globalization and localization: The application can be made accessible to users in multiple cultures and languages</li>
  <li>Live reloading: Live reloading of the app in the browser during development.</li>
  <li>Deployment: We can deploy the Blazor application on IIS and Azure Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<p>To learn more about Blazor, please refer to the <a href="http://blazor.net/">official Blazor docs</a>.</p>

            public string Id { get; set; }
            public string Question { get; set; }
            public string Answer { get; set; }
        }
    }

</code></pre>
<p>The class has the same structure as the JSON data we have inserted in the cosmos DB.</p>

<p>Right-click on the <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> FAQFunctionApp project </span> and select Add » Class. Name your class as <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> CovidFAQ.cs </span>. Put the following code inside it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-code">    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
    using System.Collections.Generic;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
    using FAQFunctionApp.Models;
    using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Http;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    namespace FAQFunctionApp
    {
        class CovidFAQ
        {
            [FunctionName("covidFAQ")]
            public static async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Run(
            [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, "get", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
            [CosmosDB(
                databaseName:"FAQDB",

                log.LogInformation("Data fetched from FAQContainer");
                return new OkObjectResult(questionSet);
            }
        }
    }

</code></pre>

<p>We have created a class <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">CovidFAQ </span> and added an Azure function to it. The attribute <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> FunctionName </span> is used to specify the name of the function. We have used the <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> HttpTrigger </span> attribute which allows the function to be triggered via an HTTP call. The attribute <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> CosmosDB </span> is used to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB. We have defined three parameters for this attribute as described below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>databaseName</strong>: the name for the cosmos DB</li>
  <li><strong>collectionName</strong>: the collecting inside the cosmos DB we want to access</li>
  <li><strong>ConnectionStringSetting</strong>: the connection string to connect to Cosmos DB. We will configure it in the next section.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have decorated the parameter <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">questionSet</span>, which is of type <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">IEnumerable FAQ </span> with the <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">CosmosDB</span> attribute. When the app is executed, the parameter <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">questionSet </span> will be populated with the data from Cosmos DB. The function will return the data using a new instance of <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">OkObjectResult</span>.</p>

<h2 id="add-the-connection-string-to-the-azure-function">Add the connection string to the Azure Function</h2>

<p>Remember the Azure cosmos DB connection string you noted earlier? Now we will configure it for our app. Open the local.settings.json file and add your connection string as shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-code">
    {
        "IsEncrypted": false,
        "Values": {
            "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
            "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
            "DBConnectionString": "your connectionn string"
        }
    }

</code></pre>

<p>The local.settings.json will not be published to Azure when we publish the Azure Function app. Therefore, we need to configure the connections string separately while publishing the app to Azure. We will see this in action in the latter part of this article.</p>

<h2 id="test-the-azure-function-locally">Test the Azure Function locally</h2>

<p>Press F5 to execute the function. Copy the URL of your function from the Azure Functions runtime output.Open the browser and paste the URL in the browser’s address bar. You can see the output as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ExecuteLocal-2.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Here you can see the data we have inserted into our Azure Cosmos DB.</p>

<h2 id="publish-the-function-app-to-azure">Publish the Function app to Azure</h2>

<p>We have successfully created the Function app, but it is still running in the localhost. Let’s publish the app to make it available globally.</p>

<p>Right-click on the <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;"> FAQFunctionApp </span> project and select Publish. Select the Publish target as Azure.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/DeploytoAZ_1.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Select the specific target as “Azure Function App (windows)”.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/DeploytoAZ_2.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>In the next window, click on the “Create a new Azure Function…” button. A new Function App window will open. Refer to the image as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/DeploytoAZ_3.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>You can fill in the details as indicated below:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: A globally unique name for your function app.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription</strong>: Select your Azure subscription name from the drop-down.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource Group</strong>: Select an existing Resource Group or create a new one.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan Type</strong>: Select Consumption. It will make sure that you pay only for  executions of your functions app.</li>
  <li><strong>Location</strong>: Select a location for your function.</li>
  <li><strong>Azure Storage</strong>: Keep the default value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Click on the “Create” button to create the Function App and return to the previous window. Make sure the option “Run from package file” is checked. Click on the Finish button.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/DeploytoAZ_4.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Now you are at the Publish page. Click on the “Manage Azure App Service Settings” button.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ManageAZappSetting.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>You will see a “Application Settings” window as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/SetConnString.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>At this point, we will configure the Remote value for the “DBConnectionString” key. This value is used when the app is deployed on Azure. Since the key for Local and Remote environment is the same in our case, click on the “Insert value from Local” button to copy the value from the Local field to the Remote field. Click on the OK button.</p>

<p>You are navigated back to the Publish page. We are done with all the configurations. Click on the Publish button to publish your Azure function app. After the app is published, get the site URL value, append <span style="color: yellow;background-color: black;">/api/covidFAQ </span> to it and open it in the browser. You can see the output as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/ExecuteGlobally.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>This is the same dataset that we got while running the app locally. This proves that our serverless Azure function is deployed and able to access the Azure Cosmos DB successfully.</p>

<h2 id="enable-cors-for-the-azure-app-service">Enable CORS for the Azure app service</h2>

<p>We will use the Function app in a Blazor UI project. To allow the Blazor app to access the Azure Function, we need to enable CORS for the Azure app service.</p>

<p>Open the Azure portal. Navigate to “All resources”. Here, you can see the App service which we have created while Publishing the app the in previous section. Click on the resource to navigate to the resource page. Click on CORS on the left navigation. A CORS details pane will open.</p>

<p>Now we have two options here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the specific origin URL to allow them to make cross-origin calls.
Remove all origin URL from the list, and use “*” wildcard to allow all the URL to make cross-origin calls.
    <ul>
      <li>We will use the second option for our app. Remove all the previously listed  URL and enter a single entry as “*” wildcard. Click on the Save button at the top. Refer to the image shown below:</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/AZFuncCors.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="create-the-blazor-web-assembly-project">Create the Blazor Web assembly project</h2>

<p>Open Visual Studio 2019, click on “Create a new project”. Select “Blazor App” and click on the “Next” button. Refer to the image shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/CreateBlazorProj_1.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>On the “Configure your new project” window, put the project name as FAQUIApp and click on the “Create” button as shown in the image below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/CreateBlazorProj_2.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>On the “Create a new Blazor app” window, select the “Blazor WebAssmebly App” template. Click on the Create button to create the project. Refer to the image shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/CreateBlazorProj_3.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>To create a new razor component, right-click on the Pages folder, select Add »Razor Component. An “Add New Item” dialog box will open, put the name of your component as CovidFAQ.razor and click on the Add button. Refer to the image shown below:</p>

<p><img src="/img/blazor/4/CreateRazorComp.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Open CovidFAQ.razor and put the following code into it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-code">    @page "/covidfaq"
    @inject HttpClient Http
    &lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
        &lt;img src="../Images/COVID_banner.jpg" alt="Image" style="width:80%; height:300px" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Frequently asked Questions on Covid-19&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;hr /&gt;
    @if (questionList == null)
    {
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loading...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    }
    else
    {
        @foreach (var question in questionList)
        {
            &lt;div class="card"&gt;
                &lt;h3 class="card-header"&gt;
                    @question.Question
                &lt;/h3&gt;
                &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
                    &lt;p class="card-text"&gt;@question.Answer&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;br /&gt;
        }
    }
    @code {
        private FAQ[] questionList;
        protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
        {
            questionList = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync&lt;FAQ[]&gt;("https://faqfunctionapp20200611160123.azurewebsites.net/api/covidFAQ");
        }
        public class FAQ
        {
            public string Id { get; set; }
            public string Question { get; set; }
            public string Answer { get; set; }
        }
    }

</code></pre>

<p>In the @code section, we have created a class called FAQ. The structure of this class is the same as that of the FAQ class we created earlier in the Azure function app. Inside the OnInitializedAsync method, we are hitting the API endpoint of our function app. The data returned from the API will be stored in a variable called questionList which is an array of type FAQ.</p>

<p>In the HTML section of the page, we have set a banner image at the top of the page. The image is available in the /wwwroot/Images folder. We will use a foreach loop to iterate over the questionList array and create a bootstrap card to display the question and answer.</p>

<p>The last step is to add the link of our CovidFAQ component in the navigation menu. Open /Shared/NavMenu.razor file and add the following code into it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-code">
    &lt;li class="nav-item px-3"&gt;
        &lt;NavLink class="nav-link" href="covidfaq"&gt;
            &lt;span class="oi oi-plus" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Covid FAQ
        &lt;/NavLink&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Remove the navigation links for Counter and Fetch-data components as they are not required for this application.</p>

<p>Press F5 to launch the app. Click on the Covid FAQ button on the nav menu on the left. You can see all the questions and answers in a beautiful card layout as shown below:</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>We learned about the serverless and its advantage over the traditional 3-tier web architecture. We also learned how the Azure function fits in serverless web architecture. To demonstrate the practical implementation of these concepts, we have created a Covid-19 FAQ app using the Blazor web assembly and Azure serverless. The questions and answers are displayed in the card layout using Bootstrap. We have used the Azure cosmos DB as the primary database to store the questions and answers for our FAQ app. An Azure function is used to fetch data from the cosmos DB. We deployed the function app on Azure to make it available globally via an API endpoint.</p>
