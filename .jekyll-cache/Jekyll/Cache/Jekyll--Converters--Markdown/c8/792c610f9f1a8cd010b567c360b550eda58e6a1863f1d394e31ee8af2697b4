<h3 id="need-for-a-vertical-slice">Need For A Vertical Slice</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s say you want to start off writing a new microservice, or developing any new application. There are several technical risks that need to be addressed , such as deciding what framework to use, identifying the layers of the architecture, figuring out communication with other systems, and so on.</p>

<p>You want to make sure you have great unit tests in place, and also have a good continuous integration and deployment system to process the builds.</p>

<p>How do we address these challenges?</p>

<h3 id="what-is-a-vertical-slice">What Is A Vertical Slice?</h3>

<p>A vertical slice involves selecting one or more of the complex or risky use cases of the systems, and implementing them first.</p>

<p>Typically, this involves addressing all the risks listed above - selecting the right framework, organizing into layers, handling communication properly, having great tests in place, and following a CI/CD process.</p>

<p>You will also deploy and test it to make sure all requirements are met.</p>

<h3 id="benefits-of-a-vertical-slice">Benefits Of A Vertical Slice</h3>

<p>A vertical slice will help you identify and solve technology risk faster. Once a vertical slice is built well, adhering to coding and other standards, it could also act as a reference point for other developers in your team.</p>

<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>

<p>Lets quickly look at a few best practices around building vertical slices:</p>

<h4 id="ensure-static-analysis">Ensure Static Analysis</h4>

<p>Make sure that a tool to perform static analysis of your code is in place during the development of the vertical slice. Also make sure development adheres to all relevant best practices.</p>

<h4 id="ensure-continuous-integration">Ensure Continuous Integration</h4>

<p>It is very important you have a continuous integration process in place, to take the vertical slice build through development, QA, staging and deployment.</p>

<h4 id="address-technical-training-issues">Address Technical Training Issues</h4>

<p>If the vertical slice is well implemented, it acts as a good reference point. This means that the development team can be trained using the vertical slice as a case study.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>It is very important that care be shown in selecting the use case for your vertical slice. Make sure that you choose a sufficiently complex use case, because you need to explore how the various technical risks will be addressed.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>In this article, we had a look at what are the technical risks involved in starting application development. We then saw how creating a vertical slice, using a complex use case, helps in exploring solutions to these risks, and acts as a reference point for the development team. We explored the best practices for creating a vertical slice, and looked at the challenges involved.</p>
