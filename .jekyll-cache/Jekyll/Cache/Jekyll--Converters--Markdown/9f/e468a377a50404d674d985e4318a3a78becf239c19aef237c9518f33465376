<h3 id="handling-cross-cutting-concerns">Handling Cross Cutting Concerns</h3>

<p>Whenever we design and develop a large software application, we make use of  a <strong>layered architecture</strong>. For instance, in a web application, it is quite common to see an architecture similar to the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Capture-02-01.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Here, we see that the application is organized into a Web layer, a Business layer, and a Data layer.</p>

<p>In a layered architecture, there are specific parts that are common to all these different layers. Such parts include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Logging</li>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Auditing</li>
</ul>

<p>All these features are applicable across layers, hence it makes sense to implement them in a common way.</p>

<p>Aspect Oriented programming is a well established way of handling these concerns. Use of constructs such as filters and interceptors is common while implementing them.</p>

<h3 id="the-need-for-api-gateway">The Need For API Gateway</h3>

<p>When we talk about a microservices architecture, we deal with multiple microservices talking to each other:

<p>Where do you implement all the features that are common across microservices?</p>
<ul>
  <li>authentication</li>
  <li>logging</li>
  <li>auditing</li>
  <li>rate limiting</li>
</ul>

<p>Thatâ€™s where the API Gateway comes into the picture.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-an-api-gateway-work">How does an API Gateway Work?</h3>

<p>In microservices, we route all requests - both internal and external - through API Gateways. We can implement all the common features like authentication, logging, auditing, and rate limiting in the API Gateway.</p>

<p>For example, you may not want Microservice3 to be called more than 10 times by a particular client. You could do that as part of rate limiting in the API gateway.</p>

<p>You can implement the common features across microservices in the API gateway. A popular API Gateway implementation is Zuul API Gateway.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Just like AOP handles cross cutting concerns in standalone applications, the API gateway manages common features for microservices in an enterprise.</p>
