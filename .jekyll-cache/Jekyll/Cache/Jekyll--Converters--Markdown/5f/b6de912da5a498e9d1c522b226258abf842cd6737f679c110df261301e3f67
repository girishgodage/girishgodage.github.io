<h3 id="what-is-software-architecture">What Is Software Architecture?</h3>

<p>To understand what software architecture is all about, let us look at the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Capture-087-02.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>This application architecture has multiple microservices - Microservice1, Microservice2 and Microservice3. There are a set of common components that handle functionality such as security, logging, archetype creation, and the like. You also have components to handle common infrastructure concerns/ These include an API Gateway, a naming server, and a centralized logging system.</p>

<h4 id="answering-some-important-questions">Answering Some Important Questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Who made the decision that there need to be three microservices, and assigned specific responsibility to each one of them?</li>
  <li>Who decided that certain functionalities of the application need to be handled by common components?</li>
  <li>Who designed the mode of interaction between the microservices and the common components?</li>
  <li>Who classifies the common infrastructure components, and designs their interfaces with each of the microservices?</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="architecture-is-all-about-making-decisions">Architecture Is All About Making Decisions</h4>

<p>Designing an application architecture is all about making such important decisions. It involves staring from a level that involves these decisions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the applications? What are their individual boundaries?</li>
  <li>What are the interactions between the individual applications? In other words, the services of which other applications are needed by a particular application?</li>
  <li>What are the common functionalities that can be identified in the system? How do you design them as components, and how to interface them with the other applications/components?</li>
  <li>What services of the system need to be abstracted into the common infrastructure? How do you decide on how to make these services available to the rest of the system?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-software-architecture">Why Do We Need Software Architecture?</h3>

<p>A few decades earlier, software programs built were small and simple. However, things have changed dramatically.</p>

<p>Software has become quite complex, with the advent of cloud computing, microservices, big data, and what not.</p>

<p>Factors that have contributed to this complexity include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Distributed Systems</strong>: Even a single web page that you may view online, might be driven by a cluster of hundreds of systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Explosion</strong>: Earlier, devices owned by users were limited to a single PC or laptop per person. Nowadays, you have a choice of mobile phones, tablets, IoT devices, and what not! Software that needs to run on  more than one device, will be complex</li>
  <li><strong>Enormous Scale</strong>: The load or the scale of users that an enterprise application needs to support has also gone up significantly</li>
  <li><strong>Technology Evolution</strong>: The languages, frameworks, tools and processes used in software development continuously undergo change, and applications need to keep pace with them</li>
  <li><strong>Non Functional Requirements</strong>: It is very important to ensure that all non functional requirements are adhered to when designing your applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge in such a dynamic scenario, is to develop applications that work today, and adapt to stay relevant tomorrow. This is the puzzle that architects try to solve.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s also the reason why you need to pay attention to the architecture, when you develop applications.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>Software architecture is all about making decisions. It mainly involves identifying applications and components, and clearly demarcating their boundaries.</p>
