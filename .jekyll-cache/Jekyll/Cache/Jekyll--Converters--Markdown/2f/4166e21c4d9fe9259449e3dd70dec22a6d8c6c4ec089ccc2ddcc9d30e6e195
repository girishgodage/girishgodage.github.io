<h2 id="healthcare-app-development-features">Healthcare App Development: Features</h2>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at some of the prominent features that are important for your healthcare app and discuss them.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mobility/2/chart-768x510.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<h2 id="features-of-patient-app">Features of Patient App</h2>

<p><strong>#1. Appointment</strong>: In a world where everything is becoming one-click away, why not book an appointment with a doctor? Booking an online appointment not only saves time by eliminating queue waiting but it is a way more convenient way for both doctors and patients.</p>

<p>This is an integrated and reliable feature in healthcare app that can facilitate timely access to consultation from anywhere in the world by connecting experienced doctors. Here‚Äôs how it works:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Users registers and fills out the necessary information.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select the doctor as per your requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select the doctor and book an appointment as per the availability. You may also mention brief information about your problems.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Once the appointment is confirmed you may view it in the schedule section.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>:  Before users actually visit the doctor, they have the option to easily upload and share health-related information and documents online.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mobility/2/interaction_design.gif" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>To integrate the appointment booking, there are plenty of API + Webhooks available for you to integrate within the app. One such example is Calendly which gives the custom integration within the product.</p>

<p><strong>#2. Telemedicine</strong>: Doctors feel telemedicine is an effective way to monitor and treat chronic conditions than the regular 10-minute one-on-one conversation. Currently, healthcare app is drastically changing the way doctor and patients interact with each other in spite of the geographical distance.</p>

<p>Its adoption has increased by 59% in the past year. Telemedicine includes in-app chat through text or video. Here‚Äôs how it works:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Answer a few questions regarding symptoms.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose an available doctor from the list.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose a convenient time-slot for an e-visit.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4</strong>: Receive an e-visit confirmation from a doctor.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5</strong>: Make a video/voice call at an agreed hour.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, for treatments which rely on physical cue needs an in-person examination. This can be replaced with photo-based consultation. This is for treatments like skin problems, bruises, eye infections, etc. In photo-based consultation, the app allows the patients to take a photograph which is stored on a separate server and can be accessed from the doctor‚Äôs app only.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mobility/2/3-1-e1542975590201.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>Further, the doctor can diagnose and message appropriate details to the patients. If more information is required, the doctor may schedule a video call and also send lab test orders via the app.</p>

<p>In a survey of medical school HCPs and students, more than 80% of respondents described using mobile devices to communicate with colleagues about patient care via email, text or multimedia message. This clearly demonstrates how critical this feature is for not only patients but doctors as well.</p>

<p>For real-time text, audio or video can be powered through WebRTC and cloud infrastructure. You may also opt for Twilio SDK for real-time communication. Dr-on-Demand uses Twilio APIs for facilitating remote diagnosis.</p>

<p><strong>#3. e-Prescription</strong>: With an e-Prescription feature, doctors can generate and send prescriptions without any errors. This saves time along with improvement in communications and patients satisfaction. This also enables doctors to view prescription insurance formulary information and also comprises all the information in electronically-connected pharmacies.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what this feature can do and why it is an added advantage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generate complete medication list along with dosage and other important details.</li>
  <li>This makes it easy for doctors to understand the patient‚Äôs history if they have visited any other doctors in the past.</li>
  <li>This also streamlines workflow processes and provides more mobility. With an e-Prescription feature, prescribers will be able to write and renew prescriptions from just anywhere.</li>
  <li>Tampering with prescriptions is not possible.</li>
  <li>Built-in pharmacy look-up for pharmacies providing the particular drugs.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/img/mobility/2/2-1-e1542974850476.png" alt="image info" /></p>

<p>e-Prescriptions, when integrated with patient‚Äôs electronic health records, enables you to log the information. This helps in creating a detailed view of a patient‚Äôs care over time.</p>

<p>However, to enable this feature, there are various compliances which you will need to take care about which we will discuss in the architecture section.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)</li>
  <li>Health Level 7 International (HL7)</li>
  <li>Food and Drug Administration (FDA)</li>
  <li>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</li>
  <li>HITECH‚Äôs Meaningful Use Stage 1 and 2 (MU-1 &amp; MU-2)</li>
  <li>Integrated with EPA (Electronic Prior Authorization), and Certified with EPCS</li>
</ul>

<p>e-Prescription can be facilitated with Twilio APIs. These APIs can be integrated with the custom product. It can send copies of the e-Prescription through SMS, email or WhatsApp.</p>

<p><strong>#4. EHR</strong>: Electronic Healthcare Records is a feature both for patients and doctors. This gives them the facility to access all of their health records in a single space. This feature of data collection and retrieval often includes the following information:</p>

  <li><strong>*  Generate and record patient-specific instructions</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You may also extend the feature‚Äôs usability with remote viewing of medical imaging scans. This works through the uploading and sharing of images through a HIPAA compliant server. In some instances, the remote evaluation of images scans via a medical device has been proven to be just as effective as viewing them at a standard workstation.</p>

<p><strong>#5. Pill Reminder</strong>: Patient loyalty towards medication and drugs is a critical factor when it comes to the treatment of chronic disease. With the significant number of people relying upon pharmacological treatments. Failure to regularly take medicine and adhere to treatment regimens may adversely affect both the patient outcomes and healthcare costs.</p>

<p>The core function of this feature is to act as a reminder. It basically sends out push notifications based on the e-prescription. Also, you can craft your own schedule as well.</p>

<p><img src="/img/mobility/2/1-1.png" alt="image info" /></p>
