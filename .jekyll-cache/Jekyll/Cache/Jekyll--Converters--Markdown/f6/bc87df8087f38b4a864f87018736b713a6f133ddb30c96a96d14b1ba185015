<p>Azure App Service enables you to <strong>build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs</strong> in the <strong>programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure</strong>. It offers <strong>auto-scaling and high availability</strong>, supports both <strong>Windows and Linux</strong>, and <strong>enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo</strong>. Learn how to use Azure App Service.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>It is an <strong>HTTP-based service</strong> for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it <strong>.NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python</strong>. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.</p>

<p>App Service not only <strong>adds the power of Microsoft Azure</strong> to your application but you can also take advantage of its <strong>DevOps capabilities</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Power of Microsoft Azure</strong>, such as security, load  balancing, autoscaling, and automated management.</p>

  <p><strong>DevOps capabilities</strong>, such as <strong>continuous deployment</strong> from <em>Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources</em>, <strong>package management</strong>, <strong>staging environments</strong>, <strong>custom domain</strong>, and <strong>SSL certificates</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With <strong>App Service</strong>, <strong>you pay for the Azure compute resources you use</strong>. The compute resources you use is determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-app-service">Why use App Service?</h2>

<p>Here are some key features of App Service:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Multiple languages and frameworks</strong> - App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also <strong>run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>DevOps optimization</strong> - Set up <strong>continuous integration and deployment</strong> with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through <strong>test and staging environments</strong>. Manage your apps in App Service by using <strong>Azure PowerShell</strong> or the <strong>cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Global scale with high availability</strong> - Scale <strong>up</strong> or <strong>out</strong> manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoftâ€™s global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service <strong>SLA</strong> promises high availability.</li>
  <li><strong>Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data</strong> - Choose from more than 50 <strong>connectors</strong> for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using <strong>Hybrid Connections</strong> and <strong>Azure Virtual Networks</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and compliance</strong> - App Service is <strong>ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant</strong>. Authenticate users with <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> or with social login (<strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft</strong>). Create <strong>IP address restrictions</strong> and <strong>manage service identities</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Application templates</strong> - Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the <strong>Azure Marketplace</strong>, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Studio integration</strong> - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.</li>
  <li><strong>API and mobile features</strong> - App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.</li>
  <li><strong>Serverless code</strong> - Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure, and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses (see <a href="/azure/azure-functions/">Azure Functions</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides App Service, Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting websites and web applications. For most scenarios, App Service is the best choice.  For microservice architecture, consider <strong>Service Fabric</strong>. If you need more control over the VMs that your code runs on, consider <strong>Azure Virtual Machines</strong>.</p>
