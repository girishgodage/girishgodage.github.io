</blockquote>

<p>In your applications you may have user flows that enable users to sign up, sign in, or manage their profile. You can create multiple user flows of different types in your Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenant and use them in your applications as needed. User flows can be reused across applications.</p>

<p>In this article, you learn how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a sign-up and sign-in user flow</li>
  <li>Create a profile editing user flow</li>
  <li>Create a password reset user flow</li>
</ul>

<p>This tutorial shows you how to create some recommended user flows by using the Azure portal.</p>

<p>If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F">free account</a> before you begin.</p>

<p>If you haven’t already created your own <a href="azure-activedirectoryB2C_CreateTenant">Azure AD B2C Tenant</a>, create one now. You can use an existing Azure AD B2C tenant.</p>
