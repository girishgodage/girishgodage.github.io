I"©<p>You would obviously want to write code that meets your core requirements and provide good performance - choosing right data structures and algorithms to use is the fundamental part of programming.</p>

<p>What are the other things that you need to worry about? Here are five things that we think are essential.</p>

<h3 id="readability-of-code">Readability of Code</h3>

<p>This is an indicator of how easy it is for another programmer, to read your code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would another programmer be able to easily understand what your classes and methods do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The critical aspect to be addressed here is how well your variables, methods and classes are named.</p>

<h3 id="reusability-of-components">Reusability of Components</h3>

<p>Before you implement a new functionality, check whether there is already a common component that can do the work for you.</p>

<p>Is any part of your feature reusable across the enterprise? Is there is a need to create a component out of this feature?</p>

<h3 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h3>

<p>The best way to systematically ensure unit tests are written, is to follow Test Driven Development (TDD). With TDD, you write the tests before you actually write the code.</p>

<p>Writing unit tests and running them regularly, is the only way to continuously improve the design of your code. If you fail to do so, your design becomes stagnant.</p>

<h3 id="non-functional-requirements">Non Functional Requirements</h3>

<p>Non functional requirements are typically those requirements which are missing in your requirement documents or user stories.</p>

<p>Examples of non functional requirements are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Security</li>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <li>Maintainability</li>
</ul>

<p>and other kinds of fun stuff! Doing well on these parameters should always be on the back of your mind.</p>

<h3 id="whats-for-dinner">Whatâ€™s For Dinner?</h3>

<p>Always have fun when you code. Programming is an intense mental activity, and keep taking fun breaks during the course of a day. It could mean pulling your teammateâ€™s leg.</p>
