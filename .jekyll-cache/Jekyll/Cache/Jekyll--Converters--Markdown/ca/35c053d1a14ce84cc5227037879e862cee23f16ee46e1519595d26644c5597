<h3 id="the-need-for-the-cloud">The Need For The Cloud</h3>

<p>Loads on applications is not consistent throughout the year:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider a startup company, which could have a potential to grow very fast.</li>
  <li>Imagine an online shopping portal, whose customer load varies throughout the year.</li>
  <li>Other online business portals, such the insurance sector, which have peak load at a particular time of the year, and very little load during other times.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you provision your infrastructure to be able to handle the peak system lead, what would that infrastructure be doing the rest of the time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of it would just be sitting idle, watching the fun.</p>

<p>That is exactly the problem cloud wants to solve.</p>

<p>Cloud intends to make it easy to provision infrastructure when you need, and just as easy to release it when you donâ€™t. This feature of the cloud has created a lot of buzz around it, over the last decade or so.</p>

<h3 id="building-applications-for-the-cloud">Building Applications For The Cloud</h3>

<p>The thing is, you cannot take any application and just put it on the cloud.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of things need to be right, in order to make an application cloud-enabled. They are known as <strong>cloud-native applications</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are best practices in place to develop such cloud-native applications, also known as the twelve-factor apps. We discuss those in a seperate article.</p>

<h4 id="advantages-of-the-cloud">Advantages Of The Cloud</h4>

<h5 id="auto-scaling-and-agility">Auto Scaling and Agility</h5>

<p>There is no longer a need to statically provision infrastructure to ensure availability for peak loads. You can do that on-demand.</p>

<h5 id="cost-reduction">Cost Reduction</h5>

<p>There are significant cost reductions with using infrastructure from the cloud, because you only use what you need for the duration you need them.</p>

<h5 id="scalability-and-elasticity">Scalability And Elasticity</h5>

<p>When applications are built well, they can auto scale based on the load.</p>

<h5 id="reliability">Reliability</h5>

<p>Since your applications are cloud-enabled, they are designed to withstand certain kinds of outages. For example, applications with microservices architecture have fault-tolerance built into them.</p>

<h3 id="migrating-applications-to-the-cloud">Migrating Applications To The Cloud</h3>

<p>It is not very straightforward to migrate your application to be cloud-enabled.</p>

<p>The first step is to make them cloud-native. The next decision to make is choosing a platform to migrate the application to. You generally have choice of platforms to migrate to, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, among others.</p>

<h3 id="best-practices">Best Practices</h3>

<p>The best practices listed for making applications cloud-native are often termed as <strong>12 factor apps</strong>. These capture the experiences of Heroku, with developing cloud enabled applications.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-with-developing-cloud-applications">Challenges With Developing Cloud Applications</h3>

<h4 id="security">Security</h4>

<p>Security is a major concern, as the infrastructure is not what you own, and it can be dynamically acquired and released.</p>

<h4 id="application-compatibility">Application Compatibility</h4>

<p>Most applications are not compatible with the cloud. Applications have to enhanced to make them cloud native.</p>

<h3 id="manifestations-of-cloud">Manifestations Of Cloud</h3>

<h4 id="iaas">IaaS</h4>

<p>Infrastructure as a service is the first level of cloud. Cloud provider only provides the hardware needed to run applications.</p>

<h4 id="paas">PaaS</h4>

<p>Platform of service is the next level of cloud, where the cloud provider provides you a platform - an operating system or managed software (databases, programming languages, web application platforms) - on top of the hardware.</p>

<h4 id="saas">SaaS</h4>

<p>Software as a Service is the third level of cloud, where the cloud provider offers a software product on the cloud - like Google Docs.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>In this article, we had a good look at the cloud. We saw that a cloud helps ease the infrastructure management of online businesses by making provisioning dynamic. A cloud could be public, or private. Using a cloud has many advantages to offer, such as agility, cost reduction and reliability.</p>
