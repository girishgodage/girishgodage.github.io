## How to Make an app like Airbnb - Develop your own Vacation Rental App

My take on making an app like Airbnb, leveraging my experience of working with 50+ Airbnb type app startups. Learn everything that you need to build and develop an app like Airbnb for vacation rental.

 There has been a lot of talk about vacation rental niche being oversaturated. But a giant like Airbnb currently owns only 10-15% of the vacation rental market. This leaves 40-50% of the market for other startups to disrupt. In fact, this leaves a huge space for another unicorn to disrupt this niche.

Before we go deep into the blog post let me brief you my thoughts behind writing this article. I know that building startups are hard, building tech startups are even harder, and after working with many startups, I just wanted to lower down the tech barrier for startups. No matter what you are trying to rent out with your app, the technology lessons will keep your app performant, and make your customers happy.

## What will you learn here?

* Basic Features of a Vacation Rental App
* Tech stack to be used for making an MVP
* Recommended Architecture to develop an app like Airbnb MVP
* Advanced Features to Delight your users
* Geolocation Map
* Improving Application Security
* In-app Chat Functionality
* Marketing, Analytics and Customer support

An app like Airbnb, even in its simplest form will allow hosts to list their property and travellers to search properties according to location. Further, travellers should be able to book property and make an online payment.

On top that, you can build other important features like in-app chat for host-guest communication and review/rating feature for both hosts and guests. Let's list down the features you will be required to build the MVP.

## What features make a typical app like Airbnb?

Organizations and startups generally start with above diagram, but, in case if you are building the final specifications of your application do match them with your feature checklist:

* Sign up and Sign in
* Account: Notification, payment methods, transaction       history, a referral from Facebook or email, wishlist
* User profiles, reviews, and recommendations
* Search functionality: Search by – destination, check in and check out dates, no. of guests, price slider, property type
* Messaging – Inbox for each user (Host and customer)
* Host: A host has functionalities like Manage listing, Reservations, policies
* Identification for Hosts and Customers: to prevent frauds and for security purposes

### How does an app like Airbnb work?

Typical booking flow of an app like Airbnb is as follows:

1. A host lists his/her property details along with pricing, rules, facilities available, etc sometimes even with nearby attractions
2. A user that is looking for a vacation rental searches for a place on the app. They typically set destination, zip codes, a search radius, price range and other preferences
3. Upon finding a perfect place to rent, a user then makes a booking request
4. The host receives a booking request and then decides whether to approve or not
5. If a host approves a request, an amount gets deducted from user's bank via a payment gateway
6. After the stay, the payment automatically gets paid to the host
7. User and host both review each other
   
Now that we have spoken about "the obvious", let's see what tech stack these apps are built from and how you can leverage my 10+ years of architecting such application to craft your own app.

## Tech stack for an app like Airbnb

![image info](/img/mobility/1/techstack-image-copy-2.jpg)

To build an app like Airbnb, you need some or all of the below-given tech stack.

* Programming Language: Javascript, Kotlin or Swift
* Front End Frameworks: Angular, React.js, Express.js
* Backend technologies or Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Django, Node.js, Meteor.js
* Server Side technologies: AWS, Azure, OpenStack,  DigitalOcean, Google Cloud
* Network level caching services: Nginx, Redis
* Databases: MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Azure DocumentDB, Cassandra, PostgreSQL

## Architecture for an Airbnb like App

Right from the start, I was able to write high performing code and was able to bring efficiency out of it. But, guess what?

> "Writing efficient code" vs "system level architecture" is very different. One requires you to think inside of a box, while the later requires you to think outside of the box.

When multiple services are working together, you don't know where the failure is going to happen. Keep in mind, failure will happen. Anything that you don't control (3rd party services like payment, email, etc) could fail, and if those are tied closely to your core services, they will fail too. Hence, the complexities!

> "When complex systems work together, it is no longer about individual component-level failures"

I am putting together an architecture here for the features we spoke about. Without talking about why this architecture is so great, let me walk you through some real business challenges this architecture is going to solve here:

* There are more users that will use "search" than users that will make a booking. You will have to make sure that the search is performant, but at the same time, you will have to ensure that the failure of search services doesn't take down your app's booking functionality. Booking is a core feature, and if I were to prioritize, I would prioritize this above everything else.
  
* Chat is a two-way freeway. We usually talk about creating an API (helps your app communicate with cloud application and database), but in this case, an API won't be able to handle chat, search and booking altogether. Keep a note that chat is real-time, single threaded(jargon!) and a high resource hungry operation. There is a need to create a separate queue service that times messages and communication with chat services.
  
* Third party services like payment gateways, verification services, customer support, etc go down all the time. Sadly, 90% uptime is not sufficient! But this has a domino effect. For example, *in poorly written apps, such failures tend to take the entire system down. For example, if your chat service provider is down, there's no reason for your listing search to not work. To me, that's a poorly thought out technology piece.*
  
* What if a host is adding his/her property details to the app just tapped "submit" button and loses internet connection at the same time? Well, the hours that he/she had put behind adding images, description, title, details, etc are now gone. Mobile forms aren't easy, web forms could be friendly, but then again do consider the attention time. Your app just asked someone to spend 20 minutes filling in some information that now suddenly is nowhere. Chances are that you are going to lose the user
  
These are some of the high-level business and tech architectural challenges I see an app like Airbnb face.

There are even more details like building microservices, architectural patterns, etc but don't confuse yourself with them for now. All you have to think about is a simple, MVP-scalable solution that is extremely flexible to help your startup or organizations pivot when needed without costing you the earth.

Enough talk, here's how you shape your architecture.

**Step #1**: Let's first create an app's user and a backend for this user

**Step #2**: Let's divide your app's backend into real services/functionalities. We are doing that as we want to separate services/functionalities that could actually crash each other. As I said before, we definitely want to separate all third-party services as we don't control them at all.

For your app the following are critical:

* Search services
* Booking services
* Payment services
* Offline-online synchronization services
* 3rd party services
* Chat services

So, here's what an evolved version of your architecture from step 1 looks like:
