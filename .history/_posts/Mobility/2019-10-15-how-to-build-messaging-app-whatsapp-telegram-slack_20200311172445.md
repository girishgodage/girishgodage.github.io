 If anyone asks me about the type of apps that I absolutely love working on, developing chat and messaging apps would top my list.

They are inherently so challenging, so complex, and at the same time so simple, that it could drastically change one's perspective on limits of **software engineering**.

I've worked with more than 10 chat apps as a part of our application development services where I was lucky enough to technically scale them beyond 10M users in a very short period of time. With this blog post, I am going to exactly show you how to make a messaging app.
