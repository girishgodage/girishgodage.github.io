 There has been a lot of talk about vacation rental niche being oversaturated. But a giant like Airbnb currently owns only 10-15% of the vacation rental market. This leaves 40-50% of the market for other startups to disrupt. In fact, this leaves a huge space for another unicorn to disrupt this niche.

Before we go deep into the blog post let me brief you my thoughts behind writing this article. I know that building startups are hard, building tech startups are even harder, and after working with many startups, I just wanted to lower down the tech barrier for startups. No matter what you are trying to rent out with your app, the technology lessons will keep your app performant, and make your customers happy.

## What will you learn here?

* Basic Features of a Vacation Rental App
* Tech stack to be used for making an MVP
* Recommended Architecture to develop an app like Airbnb MVP
* Advanced Features to Delight your users
* Geolocation Map
* Improving Application Security
* In-app Chat Functionality

An app like Airbnb, even in its simplest form will allow hosts to list their property and travellers to search properties according to location. Further, travellers should be able to book property and make an online payment.

On top that, you can build other important features like in-app chat for host-guest communication and review/rating feature for both hosts and guests. Let's list down the features you will be required to build the MVP.
