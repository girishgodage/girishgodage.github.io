**#2. Telemedicine**: Doctors feel telemedicine is an effective way to monitor and treat chronic conditions than the regular 10-minute one-on-one conversation. Currently, healthcare app is drastically changing the way doctor and patients interact with each other in spite of the geographical distance.

Further, the doctor can diagnose and message appropriate details to the patients. If more information is required, the doctor may schedule a video call and also send lab test orders via the app.

In a survey of medical school HCPs and students, more than 80% of respondents described using mobile devices to communicate with colleagues about patient care via email, text or multimedia message. This clearly demonstrates how critical this feature is for not only patients but doctors as well.

For real-time text, audio or video can be powered through WebRTC and cloud infrastructure. You may also opt for Twilio SDK for real-time communication. Dr-on-Demand uses Twilio APIs for facilitating remote diagnosis.

**#3. e-Prescription**: With an e-Prescription feature, doctors can generate and send prescriptions without any errors. This saves time along with improvement in communications and patients satisfaction. This also enables doctors to view prescription insurance formulary information and also comprises all the information in electronically-connected pharmacies.

e-Prescriptions, when integrated with patient's electronic health records, enables you to log the information. This helps in creating a detailed view of a patient's care over time.

However, to enable this feature, there are various compliances which you will need to take care about which we will discuss in the architecture section.

* Health Level 7 International (HL7)
* Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
* U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
* HITECH's Meaningful Use Stage 1 and 2 (MU-1 & MU-2)
* Integrated with EPA (Electronic Prior Authorization), and Certified with EPCS

e-Prescription can be facilitated with Twilio APIs. These APIs can be integrated with the custom product. It can send copies of the e-Prescription through SMS, email or WhatsApp.

**#4. EHR**: Electronic Healthcare Records is a feature both for patients and doctors. This gives them the facility to access all of their health records in a single space. This feature of data collection and retrieval often includes the following information:

In some instances, the remote evaluation of images scans via a medical device has been proven to be just as effective as viewing them at a standard workstation.

**#5. Pill Reminder**: Patient loyalty towards medication and drugs is a critical factor when it comes to the treatment of chronic disease. With the significant number of people relying upon pharmacological treatments. Failure to regularly take medicine and adhere to treatment regimens may adversely affect both the patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

The core function of this feature is to act as a reminder. It basically sends out push notifications based on the e-prescription. Also, you can craft your own schedule as well.
