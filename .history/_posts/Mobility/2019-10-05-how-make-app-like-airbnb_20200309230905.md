## How to Make an app like Airbnb - Develop your own Vacation Rental App

My take on making an app like Airbnb, leveraging my experience of working with 50+ Airbnb type app startups. Learn everything that you need to build and develop an app like Airbnb for vacation rental.

 ![image info](/img/mobility/1/airbnb.webp)

 There has been a lot of talk about vacation rental niche being oversaturated. But a giant like Airbnb currently owns only 10-15% of the vacation rental market. This leaves 40-50% of the market for other startups to disrupt. In fact, this leaves a huge space for another unicorn to disrupt this niche.

Before we go deep into the blog post let me brief you my thoughts behind writing this article. I know that building startups are hard, building tech startups are even harder, and after working with many startups, I just wanted to lower down the tech barrier for startups. No matter what you are trying to rent out with your app, the technology lessons will keep your app performant, and make your customers happy.

## What will you learn here?

* Basic Features of a Vacation Rental App
* Tech stack to be used for making an MVP
* Recommended Architecture to develop an app like Airbnb MVP
* Advanced Features to Delight your users
* Geolocation Map
* Improving Application Security
* In-app Chat Functionality
* Marketing, Analytics and Customer support

An app like Airbnb, even in its simplest form will allow hosts to list their property and travellers to search properties according to location. Further, travellers should be able to book property and make an online payment.

On top that, you can build other important features like in-app chat for host-guest communication and review/rating feature for both hosts and guests. Let's list down the features you will be required to build the MVP.

## What features make a typical app like Airbnb?

![image info](/img/mobility/1/airbnb-ux.jpg)

Organizations and startups generally start with above diagram, but, in case if you are building the final specifications of your application do match them with your feature checklist:

* Sign up and Sign in
* Account: Notification, payment methods, transaction       history, a referral from Facebook or email, wishlist
* User profiles, reviews, and recommendations
* Search functionality: Search by – destination, check in and check out dates, no. of guests, price slider, property type
* Messaging – Inbox for each user (Host and customer)
* Host: A host has functionalities like Manage listing, Reservations, policies
* Identification for Hosts and Customers: to prevent frauds and for security purposes

### How does an app like Airbnb work?

Typical booking flow of an app like Airbnb is as follows:

1. A host lists his/her property details along with pricing, rules, facilities available, etc sometimes even with nearby attractions
2. A user that is looking for a vacation rental searches for a place on the app. They typically set destination, zip codes, a search radius, price range and other preferences
3. Upon finding a perfect place to rent, a user then makes a booking request
4. The host receives a booking request and then decides whether to approve or not
5. If a host approves a request, an amount gets deducted from user's bank via a payment gateway
6. After the stay, the payment automatically gets paid to the host
7. User and host both review each other
   
Now that we have spoken about "the obvious", let's see what tech stack these apps are built from and how you can leverage my 10+ years of architecting such application to craft your own app.

## Tech stack for an app like Airbnb

![image info](/img/mobility/1/techstack-image-copy-2.jpg)

To build an app like Airbnb, you need some or all of the below-given tech stack.

* Programming Language: Javascript, Kotlin or Swift
* Front End Frameworks: Angular, React.js, Express.js
* Backend technologies or Frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Django, Node.js, Meteor.js
* Server Side technologies: AWS, Azure, OpenStack,  DigitalOcean, Google Cloud
* Network level caching services: Nginx, Redis
* Databases: MySQL, MSSQL, MongoDB, Azure DocumentDB, Cassandra, PostgreSQL

## Architecture for an Airbnb like App

Right from the start, I was able to write high performing code and was able to bring efficiency out of it. But, guess what?

> "Writing efficient code" vs "system level architecture" is very different. One requires you to think inside of a box, while the later requires you to think outside of the box.

When multiple services are working together, you don't know where the failure is going to happen. Keep in mind, failure will happen. Anything that you don't control (3rd party services like payment, email, etc) could fail, and if those are tied closely to your core services, they will fail too. Hence, the complexities!

> "When complex systems work together, it is no longer about individual component-level failures"

I am putting together an architecture here for the features we spoke about. Without talking about why this architecture is so great, let me walk you through some real business challenges this architecture is going to solve here:

* There are more users that will use "search" than users that will make a booking. You will have to make sure that the search is performant, but at the same time, you will have to ensure that the failure of search services doesn't take down your app's booking functionality. Booking is a core feature, and if I were to prioritize, I would prioritize this above everything else.
  
* Chat is a two-way freeway. We usually talk about creating an API (helps your app communicate with cloud application and database), but in this case, an API won't be able to handle chat, search and booking altogether. Keep a note that chat is real-time, single threaded(jargon!) and a high resource hungry operation. There is a need to create a separate queue service that times messages and communication with chat services.
  
* Third party services like payment gateways, verification services, customer support, etc go down all the time. Sadly, 90% uptime is not sufficient! But this has a domino effect. For example, *in poorly written apps, such failures tend to take the entire system down. For example, if your chat service provider is down, there's no reason for your listing search to not work. To me, that's a poorly thought out technology piece.*
  
* What if a host is adding his/her property details to the app just tapped "submit" button and loses internet connection at the same time? Well, the hours that he/she had put behind adding images, description, title, details, etc are now gone. Mobile forms aren't easy, web forms could be friendly, but then again do consider the attention time. Your app just asked someone to spend 20 minutes filling in some information that now suddenly is nowhere. Chances are that you are going to lose the user
  
These are some of the high-level business and tech architectural challenges I see an app like Airbnb face.

There are even more details like building microservices, architectural patterns, etc but don't confuse yourself with them for now. All you have to think about is a simple, MVP-scalable solution that is extremely flexible to help your startup or organizations pivot when needed without costing you the earth.

Enough talk, here's how you shape your architecture.

**Step #1**: Let's first create an app's user and a backend for this user

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Backend.png)

**Step #2**: Let's divide your app's backend into real services/functionalities. We are doing that as we want to separate services/functionalities that could actually crash each other. As I said before, we definitely want to separate all third-party services as we don't control them at all.

For your app the following are critical:

* Search services
* Booking services
* Payment services
* Offline-online synchronization services
* 3rd party services
* Chat services

So, here's what an evolved version of your architecture from step 1 looks like:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Features-separation.png)

**Step #3**: Understand that your mobile app and web users are different, they would be using different modes (API in our case) to communicate with your cloud application/backend services. I recommended this split, as it is required to prevent API level failures. Doing so would make sure that even if your mobile app isn't allowing a user to book a place, your web app still does.

So, here's the evolved architecture:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Separation-into-Web-and-Mobile.png)

Looks great right? But, here's where a software architect would dive into more details. Keep a note that this process is fairly simple, only the lack of open source knowledge restricts this from everyone to follow it.

Let's move on to step 4 and see where this architecture would go from here.

Step #4: Now, let's define the components with a bit more detail.

You have the following options for your API services:

* REST: Used for majority of the APIs developed currently
* GraphQL: Touted replacement of REST APIs
  
### #Booking services

The booking services can be written into any of the following programming languages:

* Python
* PHP
* Javascript (node.js)
  
The booking related information is stored in a MySQL database that brings reliable data storage to the Booking related events. Any disruption in a database server would mean that a user that just booked a property wouldn't be able to get the status of his booking, chances are that the booking never happened either.

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Airbnb-like-app-architecture.png)

### Search and chat services

You will read on how to implement effective search later in the sections that follow, but I would emphasize the difference in usage of Search vs other services. Your app's users would probably use chat and search a lot more than most other functionalities.

As you can see in the diagram below, I have separated search and chat services. Search services are accessed using API services, whereas, for chat service, I suggest using a queue service like Amazon MQ or any 3rd party services that we have listed below.

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Offline-Sync-for-Airbnb-like-app.png)

**Step #5**: We aren't still dealing with offline-online synchronization effectively. One fatal flaw in the entire architecture is the lack of offline support. To handle this effectively on mobile, we can use either Firebase, Realm or Couchbase to store data locally till user's mobile is in-network again. Similarly, for the web app, you can build simpler services to handle offline storage.

### Advanced Features to Delight your users

By now, you have an app that can scale to 100,000+ users, work without disruption and is flexible enough to support any modification you might need along the way to reach a product market fit. Now that you have a solid foundation for your app, let's improve your app's performance and user experience. We will talk about how to build features within your app to delight your app's users.

I am going to discuss the following features:

* User verification
* App search
* Booking features
* Comparison of different listings
* Trip cancellation
* In-app calendar
* Payment integration and management
* Geolocation
* AR and VR driven experiences
* Application security
* Chat functionality
* SEO optimized single page apps

In the sections that proceed, we will evaluate each of these features in details.

### User Verification to build a spam-free, secure app

This is the most important part of your application to create and maintain a trusted environment. it is essential for host's security and guest's travel experience. Here we will see verification process and its implementation for both hosts and Guests.

When users sign up as a Host to list their property, you need to verify their online identity and physical identity. Airbnb collects identity verification information such as images of government-issued ID, passport, national ID card, or driving license, as permitted by applicable laws.

For identity verification, you need to ask users to upload their images of government Id and selfie or scanned headshot. Further, you need to match user's image with document image to check that both are same. This process requires machine learning technology to validate a user's identity document with a facial image.

### Using third-party tools for identity verification

For a majority of the on-demand apps, I see the need to enforce identity verification at the very early stages. The reason is pretty simple, renting out your expensive real estate to someone you just met over the internet is dangerous.

Now, the good part is that it won't cost you a lot to do that!

You can simply use providers like Jumio, Shufti Pro, Onfido, etc to enable automatic identity verification within your app. I bet your investors would love that too!

The table below would help you pick up the right identity verification service:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Identity-verification-Airbnb.png)


## Optimize your app's search to deliver performance

In an app like Airbnb, the search is one of the most important interfaces which your user is most likely to interact in the first place. In Fact, it is one such primary interface that can make or break your app.

### Why you need a better search in an app like Airbnb?

Search is not magic, significant engineering goes behind it to have a search that performs well. The challenge with implementing a search with an Airbnb type app can better be illustrated with the following analogy.

Try to search a name from a list of 10 people on the same page, easy?

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Search-from-single-page.jpg)

Try search a name from a list of 1000 people on the same notebook (alphabetically ordered), not very easy, right?

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Search-from-Notebook.jpg)

Try searching name from 1000 people from 10 different notebooks, painful?

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Notebook-stack.jpg)


Now, think about searching a name from 1,000,000+ listings, from 100+ books. Got my point?

When I started helping startups with their tech stack, we had to implement complicated search algorithms on our own. I used to refer to papers on B-tree search and what not…

Fast forward in 2018, we have solutions in place to replace this expensive custom engineering, provided you know what you are picking.

A typical search for an Airbnb app should support the following search filters:

* Destination
* Property type
* Price range
* Availability
* Housing capacity
* And many more…

### The easiest route for implementing a listing search that scales

For implementing a fast, performant search in your Airbnb type application, I have found **ElasticSearch** and AWS ElasticSearch to be of great help. Both of them offer similar search capabilities, the difference though is that the former requires you to manage the services. With **AWS ElasticSearch**, you get hassle-free search solution, but that comes at a price.

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Elastic-Search.png)

Usually, this type of search functionality is not something which is straightforward to implement.

For those who don't know, Elasticsearch is a super fast open-source full-text search engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly (we are talking milliseconds here).

However, setting up elastic search correctly requires a lot of work. For instance, the data mapping, analyzers, and tokenizers need to be set correctly or you may not receive accurate search results back. Besides that, more search filters that you apply along with your search query, more complex will become the resulting search query.  To implement it in a feasible manner, you will require the provision of an expert developer.

Attached below is a flow-chart to help you out choosing the right search solution for an app like Airbnb:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/diagram00-copy.png)

### Optimize the Booking flow and experience

Navigation within a comprehensive app like Airbnb is pretty complicated. Here's how the typical booking flow happens in an Airbnb type app:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Airbnb-booking-flows.jpeg)

When a host signup in your app and activate his listing, the guest should be able to book his property for renting purpose. This requires a booking feature to be implemented in your app.

### Consider Instant Booking

> "Do you know that more than 50% of Airbnb hosts have switched to Instant booking as opposed to the normal booking feature"
This was back in 2016

Airbnb introduced instant booking in late 2017 and saw a rapid adoption of Instant booking as it became the preferred way for hosts to rent out their properties.

### How does it work?
Under normal booking functionality, the host has to approve any booking request that has been made for his/her property. Often they don't approve or disapprove soon, which either leads to a cancellation or a poor experience.

With identity verification services in place, you can allow your hosts to reliably list their properties for an instant booking option, and a user can book them instantly!

This is one of the main reasons why I think a proper MVP feature design is extremely crucial for your app. You have to think about how one feature could complement another, how network effects and system design would compliment your user experience.

The result at the end could be very effective and simple at the same time.

If you need an inspiration for this, this is one of the Airbnb's killer feature and if you are interested you can read through the section below to understand a simple math behind their Instant booking filter.

> 2 out of 3 booking on Airbnb happens with Instant Booking

### The math behind Airbnb's Instant booking features

Airbnb dynamically determines whether to show instant booking to someone or not. At the same time, they wish to maximize the number of bookings being made.

For every search on Airbnb, they create two ranking scores:

* Search Score associated with each search
* A request to book score

On top of these two, there are two additional factors:

* Seasonality
* And the platform on which the user is using their app

The entire goal of Airbnb is to increase Instant books without reducing the booking score. In the end, we end up with an equation like this at the core of our minimization process to maximize instant booking:

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Airbnb-search-score.png)

When the search score finds a user search eligible to be a part of the instant booking, Airbnb automatically turns on the Instant search filter and alert the users with a tooltip.

**Proposed Solution**: I feel that the Instant book feature can be tweaked in at least 10 different ways. *For example, you can simply add a countdown timer to trigger instant purchase intents. I suggested that out-of-context, but you should always consider your use case before jumping to conclusions.*

### Processing Payment through your app

If you want to integrate a payment functionality in your app, then there are many payment gateways that might be helpful for you.

Should you be worried about the payment compliance(PCI)?

With these payment gateways providers in place, you don't need to worry about 99% of the payment related security issues. All you have to do is to make sure that you follow all best practices suggested by the payment gateway provider.

At the end of the Payment gateway integration process, you will be prompted by your provider to fill in a PCI SAQ_AEP form. This form is a declaration that you followed all best practices to secure your customers. That's it!

**Stripe** – Once in place, Stripe processes the payment through its own servers – so you don't have to store sensitive data or worry about being PCI compliant – takes a small percentage and checks for fraud. Stripe accepts all major debit and credit cards from more than 135 currencies. It charges a fixed $.30 fee + 2.9% of every transaction that is made on a card or digital wallet.

**Braintree** – Braintree also accepts all major debit and credit cards from more than 130 currencies. Similar to Stripe, Braintree also charges 2.9% + $0.3 per transaction that is made on a card or digital wallet. Braintree also provides a split payment functionality which is an absolute necessity when a group of people are using the same service ex: sharing a rental space in the case of Airbnb

If you are thinking about building your Airbnb type app in React native, I should pre-warn you about the fact that there are very few payment gateway providers that are actually providing an SDK for React Native. You are most likely to end up creating a wrapper around native apps to integrate them with your app. This is painful to manage and it is even painful to keep your wrappers updated with each and every release.

## Make it easy for user to learn more about the place they are going to rent

> Do you know that "Majority of renting decisions made by users in Airbnb is greatly influenced by the kind of comfort and facilities provided at the host's place"?

These minute details on the rental property and available facilities are often what makes someone feel at home, get a taste of the local culture or inform them how luxurious the vacation would be.

## Compare different rental properties
An app like Airbnb does have a feature of saving the favorite houses to a list. Even with this feature in place:

* A user had to look through the different houses individually
Memorize them to compare and then take a decision.
* Information overload adds unnecessary complexity to your app's user experience

**Proposed Solution**: In order to solve this problem, an app like Airbnb shall consist of a comparison feature. I recommend having a comparison feature on top of the existing favorites list. When the user views their list, all the houses within that list would be selected by default. The user would be able to select or deselect their desired houses, then click on the Compare button to generate a list showing a side-by-side comparison of various properties. [See below Image for reference]

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Compare-feature-in-Anirbnb-like-App.png)

### Trip Cancellation at the last minute

Building a successful app requires you to think like a user. In some vacation rental apps (even Airbnb), the host can cancel the booking at the 11th hour. If you have been in this situation before, you would find yourself swore never to use this app.

![image info](/img/mobility/1/Cancellation.png)

But, your app can do better. You can reduce last-minute cancellations by simply:

* Adding a cancellation fee: For every last minute cancellation by the host, the host will incur a cancellation fee.

* Add # of cancellations to the profile of host: This will not only just improve the trustworthiness of a legit host but would also force them to only cancel a booking when they absolutely have no other options

* Block calendar dates for last minute cancellations: Another way in which on-demand rental apps have been dealing with last minute cancellations is by blocking the calendar dates for which last-minute cancellations happened. By doing so, the host won't be able to leverage surge pricing at the last moment and will be blocked from accepting any request on those dates.

Dealing with last minute cancellations is a bit tricky, you can look into what works best for your audience. Another alternative to the three approach would be to provide a rental place nearby as an alternative when a host cancels out of the blue.

### Your app's calendar is a killer feature, but you don't know it yet!

If you are managing a business, you would already know, managing your calendar is extremely important. For an app like Airbnb, it is quite common for hosts to accept a booking request only to later learn that the dates won't work for the host.

We have already established that last minute cancellations are a huge deal for a two-sided marketplace like Airbnb. Here, the host is making a cancellation because he/she wasn't managing a calendar.

This is where an optimized user experience for a two-sided marketplace comes into the picture.
