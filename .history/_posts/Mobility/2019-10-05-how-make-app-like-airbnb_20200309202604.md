My take on making an app like Airbnb, leveraging my experience of working with 50+ Airbnb type app startups. Learn everything that you need to build and develop an app like Airbnb for vacation rental.

 There has been a lot of talk about vacation rental niche being oversaturated. But a giant like Airbnb currently owns only 10-15% of the vacation rental market. This leaves 40-50% of the market for other startups to disrupt. In fact, this leaves a huge space for another unicorn to disrupt this niche.

Before we go deep into the blog post let me brief you my thoughts behind writing this article. I know that building startups are hard, building tech startups are even harder, and after working with many startups, I just wanted to lower down the tech barrier for startups. No matter what you are trying to rent out with your app, the technology lessons will keep your app performant, and make your customers happy.

## What will you learn here?

* Basic Features of a Vacation Rental App
* Tech stack to be used for making an MVP
* Recommended Architecture to develop an app like Airbnb MVP
* Advanced Features to Delight your users
* Geolocation Map
* Improving Application Security
* In-app Chat Functionality
* Marketing, Analytics and Customer support

An app like Airbnb, even in its simplest form will allow hosts to list their property and travellers to search properties according to location. Further, travellers should be able to book property and make an online payment.

On top that, you can build other important features like in-app chat for host-guest communication and review/rating feature for both hosts and guests. Let's list down the features you will be required to build the MVP.

## What features make a typical app like Airbnb?

Organizations and startups generally start with above diagram, but, in case if you are building the final specifications of your application do match them with your feature checklist:

* Sign up and Sign in
* Account: Notification, payment methods, transaction       history, a referral from Facebook or email, wishlist
* User profiles, reviews, and recommendations
* Search functionality: Search by – destination, check in and check out dates, no. of guests, price slider, property type
* Messaging – Inbox for each user (Host and customer)
* Host: A host has functionalities like Manage listing, Reservations, policies
* Identification for Hosts and Customers: to prevent frauds and for security purposes

### How does an app like Airbnb work?

Typical booking flow of an app like Airbnb is as follows:

1. A host lists his/her property details along with pricing, rules, facilities available, etc sometimes even with nearby attractions
2. A user that is looking for a vacation rental searches for a place on the app. They typically set destination, zip codes, a search radius, price range and other preferences
3. Upon finding a perfect place to rent, a user then makes a booking request
4. The host receives a booking request and then decides whether to approve or not
5. If a host approves a request, an amount gets deducted from user's bank via a payment gateway
6. After the stay, the payment automatically gets paid to the host
7. User and host both review each other
   
Now that we have spoken about "the obvious", let's see what tech stack these apps are built from and how you can leverage my 10+ years of architecting such application to craft your own app.
