To integrate the appointment booking, there are plenty of API + Webhooks available for you to integrate within the app. One such example is Calendly which gives the custom integration within the product.

**#2. Telemedicine**: Doctors feel telemedicine is an effective way to monitor and treat chronic conditions than the regular 10-minute one-on-one conversation. Currently, healthcare app is drastically changing the way doctor and patients interact with each other in spite of the geographical distance.

Its adoption has increased by 59% in the past year. Telemedicine includes in-app chat through text or video. Here's how it works:

* **Step 1**: Answer a few questions regarding symptoms.
* **Step 2**: Choose an available doctor from the list.
* **Step 3**: Choose a convenient time-slot for an e-visit.
* **Step 4**: Receive an e-visit confirmation from a doctor.
* **Step 5**: Make a video/voice call at an agreed hour.

However, for treatments which rely on physical cue needs an in-person examination. This can be replaced with photo-based consultation. This is for treatments like skin problems, bruises, eye infections, etc. In photo-based consultation, the app allows the patients to take a photograph which is stored on a separate server and can be accessed from the doctor's app only.

![image info](/img/mobility/2/3-1-e1542975590201.png)

Further, the doctor can diagnose and message appropriate details to the patients. If more information is required, the doctor may schedule a video call and also send lab test orders via the app.

In a survey of medical school HCPs and students, more than 80% of respondents described using mobile devices to communicate with colleagues about patient care via email, text or multimedia message. This clearly demonstrates how critical this feature is for not only patients but doctors as well.

For real-time text, audio or video can be powered through WebRTC and cloud infrastructure. You may also opt for Twilio SDK for real-time communication. Dr-on-Demand uses Twilio APIs for facilitating remote diagnosis.

**#3. e-Prescription**: With an e-Prescription feature, doctors can generate and send prescriptions without any errors. This saves time along with improvement in communications and patients satisfaction. This also enables doctors to view prescription insurance formulary information and also comprises all the information in electronically-connected pharmacies.

Here's what this feature can do and why it is an added advantage:

* Generate complete medication list along with dosage and other important details.
* This makes it easy for doctors to understand the patient's history if they have visited any other doctors in the past.
* This also streamlines workflow processes and provides more mobility. With an e-Prescription feature, prescribers will be able to write and renew prescriptions from just anywhere.
* Tampering with prescriptions is not possible.

e-Prescriptions, when integrated with patient's electronic health records, enables you to log the information. This helps in creating a detailed view of a patient's care over time.

However, to enable this feature, there are various compliances which you will need to take care about which we will discuss in the architecture section.

* Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
* Health Level 7 International (HL7)
* Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
* U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
* HITECH's Meaningful Use Stage 1 and 2 (MU-1 & MU-2)
* Integrated with EPA (Electronic Prior Authorization), and Certified with EPCS

e-Prescription can be facilitated with Twilio APIs. These APIs can be integrated with the custom product. It can send copies of the e-Prescription through SMS, email or WhatsApp.

**#4. EHR**: Electronic Healthcare Records is a feature both for patients and doctors. This gives them the facility to access all of their health records in a single space. This feature of data collection and retrieval often includes the following information:

You may also extend the feature's usability with remote viewing of medical imaging scans. This works through the uploading and sharing of images through a HIPAA compliant server. In some instances, the remote evaluation of images scans via a medical device has been proven to be just as effective as viewing them at a standard workstation.

**#5. Pill Reminder**: Patient loyalty towards medication and drugs is a critical factor when it comes to the treatment of chronic disease. With the significant number of people relying upon pharmacological treatments. Failure to regularly take medicine and adhere to treatment regimens may adversely affect both the patient outcomes and healthcare costs.

The core function of this feature is to act as a reminder. It basically sends out push notifications based on the e-prescription. Also, you can craft your own schedule as well.

The possible technology suggestion for enabling this features are beacons and geofencing.

## Features of Doctor App
**#1. Doctor's Profile**: One of the critical aspects of the patient's journey is finding an appropriate physician. Selecting any out of the list isn't an appropriate option. Doctor's profile saves time for both patients and doctors. This also improves the accuracy of doctor and patient match-making process.

Here are some of the things which you should keep in mind while developing this feature:

*  While showcasing the doctor, it is advisable to include the doctor's expertise, qualifications, professional degrees and certificates, experience and others.
*  It should also provide the exact location of the doctor including their immediate contact details.
*  Reviews and ratings from the past users would be an added advantage for first-time patients with that specific physician.

*  There can also be an additional section where special remarks pertaining to the patient's medical history can be described such as immunizations, special diseases, allergies, etc.

**#4. ePrescription**: If you're not familiar already, this is a technology framework that allows doctors to write and send prescriptions to their patients as well as pharmacies. According to a Surescripts report, 44% of all prescriptions were written electronically in the past year.

ePrescriptions works as a decision support tool giving providers an immediate access to an individual's medication history and details of their prescription insurance coverage- all in order to make better-informed choices.

At a basic level, e-Prescriptions work as an electronic reference handbook. More sophisticated versions can create and refill prescriptions for patients, manage medications and view patient history, connect to a pharmacy or other drug dispensing site and integrate with an electronic medical record system.

This feature is one of the most sought after since it reduces the number of prescription errors attributed to bad handwriting or illegible faxes.

* This allows doctors to take photographs from any consultation room using on-screen positioning guides and levelling tools to maintain the consistency.
* Customizable photo-sequencing makes sure that the photograph of every patient has the same set of aesthetic prerequisites for the procedure- no angle or position missed.
* Also, the photo management system automatically classifies the patient photos by patient name and demography so that it can be used as cosmetic and dermatic documentation.

Clinical Photo Capture feature can be built through multi-level security protocols that keep their images secure, track who is accessing the system and the actions being taken with the photograph at any moment. This is a HIPAA compliant service which eases out the time-consuming process of photo management.

**#5. Decision Support Systems**: Mobile apps have turned out to be invaluable tools that support clinical decision-making at the point of care. After every clinical encounter, doctors may not always have answers to the clinical queries. This is where clinical decision-making systems play an important role, especially in evidence-based treatments.
