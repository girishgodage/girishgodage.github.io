## Key Benefits of Angular & Use Cases

 Have you ever struggled to optimize server communication for your application? Or found it difficult to handle auto-synchronization in an application? You've come to the right place. Angular, as one of the top frontend framework, handles this proactively. Let's discuss some of the key benefits and widely applied use cases of Angular.

Angular has come a long way since its inception. The Angular team at Google keeps the framework upgraded with the constant evolution of browsers and their ability to support diverse functionalities over time. And today, it is one of the most preferred choices for **developing feature-rich web applications.**

Its user interface and functionality have been acknowledged by several companies and developer communities from time and again. Thanks to Angular business benefits, **over 72,924 websites** in the US alone use the framework for website development. 

Developers understand the critical challenges and shortcomings in developing a Single Page Application (SPA). While the initial Angular development benefits were more inclined towards tackling that challenge, it gradually evolved to fix several concerns, including mobile optimization, progressive web app development, and more.

We work on various small and large scale projects. While some use Angular, a lot of them use React, a bunch of them are exploring Vue.js, and a few are still using jQuery. This post is directed towards people who are considering Angular & TypeScript as their choice for frontend engineering. Let's dig deeper into the Agular advantages and disadvantages to help you evaluate your decision better.

### Automatic Synchronization with Two-Way Data Binding
With most frameworks offering one-way data binding, this feature gives Angular an edge over the others. So what's the deal with two-way data binding? 

It synchronizes the data between Model and View. As a result, when data is changed or modified, these two components automatically get updated. What's more, this happens in real-time, preventing developers from putting extra efforts into manual modifications.

Unlike other web frameworks, which implement two-way data binding by using fragile event listeners and handlers, Angular makes this process an integral function of its architecture. Consequently, there's little need for sequential callbacks to handle modified data or developer interventions. 

### Optimized Server Communication
Caching becomes trouble-free with Angular!

Angular reduces the extra burden of CPUs by creating static files. Besides, the response time to API calls is tremendously quick in the framework. 

 Referring to an Angular application, we can see it renders the pages in the document object model for the user actions. The framework reduces its efforts just by generating the static app pages, unlike other tech stacks. It gives an overall quick user experience and does not let the users wait until the app becomes completely interactive. 

### POJO Model to Eliminate External Dependencies
Angular employs the Plain Old Javascript Objects (POJO) Model to make the code structure handy and independent. This way, we save ourselves from adding complex functions or methods in the programme. Additionally, it eliminates dependencies on external frameworks or plugins.

 The model enables us to keep our codes clean, making the framework goal-oriented since POJO requires less coding, the applications built with Angular load quickly, and offer excellent user accessibility.

### Testing in Angular – An Integral Part
Testing is an integral part of the Angular framework. All JavaScript code in Angular is required to go through a series of tests. The convenience offered in testing allows us to develop the project from scratch and seamlessly test the components. 

 Thanks to the dependency injection in Angular. It manages all the scopes and controllers. Because of this dependency, the unit test functionality in Angular can force dependency injection to perform testing by injecting mock/dummy data into the controller. This process is followed by the assessment of the output and its behavior. What's more interesting is that Angular also has mock HTTP providers to push fake responses from servers into controllers.

### Angular Material – A Comprehensive Modern UI
The Angular Materials follows the Material Design guidelines by Google. It provides in-built components such as navigation elements, layout, button, indicators, and data tables.

Moreover, Angular Material is not just about creating an eye-pleasant user interface, but it develops applications like Google. For instance, apps like Google drive, Android OS, Gmail, and many have become daily needs of users. 

### Angular & Single Page Applications
There are two aspects to the smooth functioning of any single page application. One is that all the mandatory codes of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are retrieved at one single instance when the page loads. The second is that they are retrieved as and when required depending on user behavior and action.

There is no page reload happening at any point in time while users are browsing the app, which in turn involves dynamic communication with servers under the hood. However, all these complexities are easily handled by Angular. If your product idea revolves around the development of a radical single-page application, preferring Angular for its development would be the best decision you would make.

### Code Consistency and Robust Ecosystem
For any strong development environment to be successful, code consistency is the key. Thanks to the Angular CLI and documentation style guide, they both drive consistency at the pioneer level. 

Angular CLI tool lets the developer create initial projects, run the tests, and add different features in the same project while keeping the entire team on the same page. Often, I found developers to be thankful for the style guide that Angular offers. This way, the communication between the team becomes comfortable and less likely to be misinterpreted.

Thanks to the robust ecosystem of the framework that has exceptionally given the power of dependency injection and other resources to the developer communities. 

### Model-View-Viewmodel (MMVC) Architecture to Unify Independent Structures
Angular simplifies the development structure by combining MMVC architecture and two-way data binding. In fact, it takes very little time for this framework to update the changes made in the view layer to the data and vice-versa. Consequently, it is why most developers favor Angular when it comes to building large-scale applications. 

Given that the framework isolates the business logic from the UI components, developers are more confident in designing the neat user interface with smooth business logic applicable. Thanks to the quickest communication established between the model and the view component by the controller. Because of which display of data happens as quickly as possible. 

### Ivy Renderer – Next-Generation Renderer for Enhanced Performance
This new Angular engine is all about its super-optimized bundle size, loading speed, and dynamic loading of components. 

Ivy renderer aims for unparalleled code debugging and user-friendly app experience. It makes the framework accessible and sets an example by reducing the file sizes though making the framework a feature-rich platform. Since it was introduced in NG-CONF 2018, then it wasn't in its complete form, but currently, Angular 8 serves the best of it. The modern Angular engine will be in its full form with the release of Angular 9. 

### Active Community & Easy-to-Access Information

Ever since its onset, Angular has been a favorite among developers and engineers for its myriad of advantages. With a pool of resources like study materials, reference documents, FAQs, and others, Angular is easy to integrate for those who want to make the most out of it.
