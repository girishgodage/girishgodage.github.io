## Key Benefits of Angular & Use Cases

 Have you ever struggled to optimize server communication for your application? Or found it difficult to handle auto-synchronization in an application? You've come to the right place. Angular, as one of the top frontend framework, handles this proactively. Let's discuss some of the key benefits and widely applied use cases of Angular.

Angular has come a long way since its inception. The Angular team at Google keeps the framework upgraded with the constant evolution of browsers and their ability to support diverse functionalities over time. And today, it is one of the most preferred choices for **developing feature-rich web applications.**

Its user interface and functionality have been acknowledged by several companies and developer communities from time and again. Thanks to Angular business benefits, **over 72,924 websites** in the US alone use the framework for website development. 

Developers understand the critical challenges and shortcomings in developing a Single Page Application (SPA). While the initial Angular development benefits were more inclined towards tackling that challenge, it gradually evolved to fix several concerns, including mobile optimization, progressive web app development, and more.

We work on various small and large scale projects. While some use Angular, a lot of them use React, a bunch of them are exploring Vue.js, and a few are still using jQuery. This post is directed towards people who are considering Angular & TypeScript as their choice for frontend engineering. Let's dig deeper into the Agular advantages and disadvantages to help you evaluate your decision better.

## Benefits of Angular for Web Development

### Automatic Synchronization with Two-Way Data Binding
With most frameworks offering one-way data binding, this feature gives Angular an edge over the others. So what's the deal with two-way data binding? 

It synchronizes the data between Model and View. As a result, when data is changed or modified, these two components automatically get updated. What's more, this happens in real-time, preventing developers from putting extra efforts into manual modifications.

Unlike other web frameworks, which implement two-way data binding by using fragile event listeners and handlers, Angular makes this process an integral function of its architecture. Consequently, there's little need for sequential callbacks to handle modified data or developer interventions. 

### Optimized Server Communication
Caching becomes trouble-free with Angular!

Angular reduces the extra burden of CPUs by creating static files. Besides, the response time to API calls is tremendously quick in the framework. 

 Referring to an Angular application, we can see it renders the pages in the document object model for the user actions. The framework reduces its efforts just by generating the static app pages, unlike other tech stacks. It gives an overall quick user experience and does not let the users wait until the app becomes completely interactive. 

### POJO Model to Eliminate External Dependencies
Angular employs the Plain Old Javascript Objects (POJO) Model to make the code structure handy and independent. This way, we save ourselves from adding complex functions or methods in the programme. Additionally, it eliminates dependencies on external frameworks or plugins.

 The model enables us to keep our codes clean, making the framework goal-oriented since POJO requires less coding, the applications built with Angular load quickly, and offer excellent user accessibility.

### Testing in Angular – An Integral Part
Testing is an integral part of the Angular framework. All JavaScript code in Angular is required to go through a series of tests. The convenience offered in testing allows us to develop the project from scratch and seamlessly test the components. 

 Thanks to the dependency injection in Angular. It manages all the scopes and controllers. Because of this dependency, the unit test functionality in Angular can force dependency injection to perform testing by injecting mock/dummy data into the controller. This process is followed by the assessment of the output and its behavior. What's more interesting is that Angular also has mock HTTP providers to push fake responses from servers into controllers.

### Angular Material – A Comprehensive Modern UI
The Angular Materials follows the Material Design guidelines by Google. It provides in-built components such as navigation elements, layout, button, indicators, and data tables.

Moreover, Angular Material is not just about creating an eye-pleasant user interface, but it develops applications like Google. For instance, apps like Google drive, Android OS, Gmail, and many have become daily needs of users. 

### Angular & Single Page Applications
There are two aspects to the smooth functioning of any single page application. One is that all the mandatory codes of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML are retrieved at one single instance when the page loads. The second is that they are retrieved as and when required depending on user behavior and action.
