## 6 Multi-Cloud Architecture Designs for an Effective Cloud Strategy

Deploying a multi-tenant application across multiple cloud platforms can be very challenging. In this blog, we've explained 6 multi-cloud architecture designs which can help businesses to build an effective multi-cloud strategy.

Enterprises increasingly want to take advantage of the flexibility and choice of multiple cloud offerings in order to use best cloud services while achieving satisfactory cost reduction benefits. In fact, the International Data Corporation predicted in a futurescape report last year that multi-cloud adoption will increase drastically and more than 85% of enterprise IT corporations will invest in multi-cloud architecture by 2020. With the enterprise hurtling towards digital transformation at breakneck speeds, the adoption of cloud, both public and private, has accelerated. And working across different clouds across various platforms brings a whole lot of challenges in its wake. **Lack of understanding of cloud technology** is the most basic one which CTO's face.

This is the first blog of our three blog series on multi-cloud system architecture. In this blog, you will get to know about multi-cloud architecture design for different organizational requirements. In the second blog, we have discussed **Strategies to manage Multi-cloud environment effectively.**

Now before moving to the Multi-cloud architecture, just have a brief understanding of basic cloud architecture models.

## How Basic Cloud Architecture Looks Like?

The basic cloud architecture which is quite common around the web is 3-Tier architecture.

The architecture consists of 3 major tiers â€“ Load balancer server, Application Server, Database Server. There is one dedicated server for each tier.

As in the above cloud architecture diagram, for failover and recovery purpose we have used redundant server at each tier. This is called Redundant 3-Tier architecture, used in production environment. Non-redundant architecture which consist of single server for each tier are only for testing the interactivity between each tier of your application.

This is the most basic one, you can use additional server depending on the application. For example, to add faster backup functionality in my app, I have used Striped Volume set at the database tier.

Now let's take an ***example of Netflix***.

How Netflix manages such a huge collection of videos and provides a great streaming experience without disruptions?

This is because of its multi-data centers located geographically around the world which backups each other in case of any disaster. Also streaming from local datacenter giver faster viewing experience.

In the above architecture we can have multi-datacenter, each having its own load balancer tier, Application tier and Database tier.

How it can be done? Look at the below image.

The most fascinating experience of cloud is its horizontal Auto Scaling feature. This gives you the ability to grow or shrink number of server resources on demand, and this work is done by load balancer. We have added Server Arrays to set up a particular tier of architecture to autoscale based on predefined alert conditions.
