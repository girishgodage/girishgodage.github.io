summary: Like most of the existing cloud application development trends, Serverless
  and Containers have been widely spoken-of and discussed among developers. Some feel
  that Serverless originated as an alternative to containerization and some feel serverless
  can be used with containers for application deployment. The difference between Serverless
  and Containerization is not limited to performance, but also applicable for longevity
  limitations, application scalability, time-of-deployment etc.
