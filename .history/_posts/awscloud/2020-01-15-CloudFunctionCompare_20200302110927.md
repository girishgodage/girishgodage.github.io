## Comparing Serverless Providers

 Wondering which serverless provider is right for you? Read this blog to understand and analyze the comparison between AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs Google Cloud Functions. Get to know their current version and compare performance, security, pricing and scalability.

 When it comes to serverless providers, there are many popular opinions based on various biases. Yet, while choosing the serverless there are many things that go on than the surface picture.

Considering how critical this is for long-term success, platforms should be evaluated based on their functionalities and service integrations. The potential backlash in choosing a serverless platform is high. Some of them are vendor lock-in and data lock-in, as Patrick Debois, CTO at Zender, mentions in his tweet.

So how do you select the right serverless provider? The answer is in this article. Here we discuss the major serverless provider considering their technical empowerment which will help you to equally weigh the selection process directed towards your specific needs.

### Current Version:

As of today, AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs Google Cloud Functions all are production ready and generally available. Reflecting over the timeline, AWS Lambda became publicly available in early 2015, Azure Functions in late 2016 while Google Cloud Functions, just recently, in July 2018.

With such a big difference in their timeline, it is evident that AWS Lambda dominates the *serverless landscape* with the huge developer community and the wide spectrum of use cases. Moreover, it has advanced functionalities like edge processing and chaining.

Azure Functions supports the variety of supported runtime environment. The current approach of Azure is to provide a functional IDE in their portal to help you prototype and deploy functions.

When it comes to picking anyone out of this, the prerequisites and the evaluation criteria that you’ll employ will be unique to your organization. However, there are some common areas that these serverless providers fall into. Let’s discuss some of them.

### Language Support & Deployment

AWS Lambda currently has native support for code written in JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Java and C#, along with releasing support for Golang earlier this year. These wide choices of runtime environments and its versatility makes it the first choice for developers.

AWS Lambda provides API operations that you can use to create and update Lambda functions with the help of a deployment package uploaded to the console in a ZIP file or edited within the console itself.

> Dependency management aside the biggest barrier to entry is language runtime support. Most FaaS platforms only support a handful of language runtimes. AWS Lambda and Azure Functions being the exceptions as both platforms support most popular language runtimes.— Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) February 26, 2018

On the other hand, Azure Function supports C#, F#, Python, Java, Node.js, Python & PHP. Contrary to AWS Lambda, Azure Functions provides you with multiple options for deploying your function, such as GitHub, DropBox, Visual Studio, Kudu Console, Zip deployment and One Drive.

With Google Cloud Functions, your function execution varies by your chosen language. Currently, it supports Node.js 6, Node.js 7 and Python 3.7 with more to be supported soon. For deployment, you can choose either of these: CLI, Zip upload, inline web editor, Cloud Storage and Cloud Storage Repositories.

Truple.io is currently using AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework. According to its cloud architect, they used Azure Functions for 6 months but didn’t have a good experience. Eventually, they abandoned Azure Functions and moved to  Kubernetes. Here why,

"*AWS Lambda had most of the problems solved already for Node.Js. It has good scalability without any resource issues. AWS Lambda, I feel it works as it is promised. However, with C#, I did use it on AWS Lambda the week after it was released. However, it had some issues that were solved after almost 8 months.*

*On the contrary, in Azure Functions, I was using C#  and we continually had issue after issue. Due to lack of documentation, we were constantly running into issues. Not only that, App Insights (monitoring platform for Azure Functions) took 5+ minutes to load the logs.*

*Apart from this, we recently faced issues with Azure CDN, where we were unable to purge files so old, outdated files continued to be served up for 16+ hours after the purge. Cloudfront in AWS invalidates works in less than 15 minutes every time I do it”*

### Dependencies Management
With AWS Lambda, dependencies are packaged within the deployment packages itself. To do it successfully, you first need to organize your code and dependencies in a certain way.

Guidelines for creating the deployment package varies depending upon your choice of language. You may also use build plugins such as Jenkins (for Node.js and Python) and Maven (Java) to create the packages.

With Azure Functions, You can include your package.json in your function directory and run npm install as you normally would with Node.js projects using Kudu or the Console in the Azure portal. This process is similar irrespective of your runtime language.

Google Cloud Functions let you manage your dependencies with npm and are expressed in a metadata file called package.json. Your function also has an option to downloads the dependencies declared in package.json using npm.

Google Cloud Functions install dependencies on behalf of the user, which means that they do not need to take awkward steps like “vendoring” them locally (required for AWS Lambda) and they also avoid potential pitfalls, e.g., if the developer is using a Windows machine and vendors a library with native extensions (C code), there’s a high probability that it will not work on AWS Lambda when deployed.

### Persistent Storage
The essence of serverless functions lies in its statelessness. Saying that an ideal function would be the one written in a stateless style which has no affinity to the underlying compute infrastructure or other variables.

With AWS Lambda, the function is required to be written without any variables. At the same time, you have an option for storage of variables in the persistent storage such as S3, DynamoDB or any other cloud storage services.

With Azure Functions to store the persistent data that needs to be constant across numerous instances, you may use Azure Blob Storage or Azure Table Storage.

If you want to “cache” data, for instance, a DB connection, you can use static variables. For Google Cloud Functions, if you require to share state across function invocations, your function should use services such as Cloud Datastore, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage and Cloud SQL to persist data.

### Identity & Access Management
For Identity and access management, IAM system provides you with an authorization layer that allows you to exercise fine-grained access management for your functions.

For example, what they can do with those resources (read-only or write-only access), and what areas they have access to (specific function or whole project).

AWS Lambda provides you with the facility to create your own custom IAM policies and attach them with your Lambda functions. This allows permissions for AWS Lambda API actions, users, groups, roles and resources.

While Azure Functions lets you control your function policies through Resource Based Access Control. It is supported at Subscription and ResourceGroup. Though at the moment, you can give permission to read/write access both to your functions as read-only access disables some of the app’s features.

However, with Google Cloud Functions’ IAM roles you can list the permissions that are contained in each role. Roles can be granted to users on an entire project or on individual functions. Though there are more features in Alpha version soon to be released publicly.
