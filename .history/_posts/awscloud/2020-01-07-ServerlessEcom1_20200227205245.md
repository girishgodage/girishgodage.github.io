### How to Build an E-commerce App using Serverless ?

 Learn how to build an ecommerce app using serverless architecture (reference architecture added). Start with an MVP and design the microservices using AWS Lambda functions to reap the benefits of event-driven architecture.

 Serverless Architecture- the term which has been added to the technology stack, a few years ago, is becoming a common use since the launch of AWS Lambda in 2014.

The evidence is- Raymond Camden, Serverless Developer Advocate quoting that serverless will become ‘less of a hot new thing’ and more of a ‘just another option’ and it is becoming a reality now. One of the main reason is that it provocatively illustrates one of the biggest headaches of the IT industry- server administration. In short, write your code and run your applications without provisioning or managing anything on the server side.

> But is the sweet reality is good as it is promised?

Well, let’s put this question on the test as we build an e-commerce app based upon serverless architecture using AWS stack.

Over the years, I’ve observed that many enterprises don’t know how to build such apps and ignore the massive benefits they have to offer due to insufficient knowledge. And that’s what I will be sharing with you in this post.

### Features for Building an MVP for a Serverless E-commerce Application

Before we jump onto architecting the tech stack for our ecommerce app, let’s discuss some of the basic features for our MVP.

* **User authentication and authorization:**
The first feature that comes to your mind while you think of an ecommerce app is user pool authentication & management. The aim here is to provide a seamless registration process while demanding the least possible information.

* **Product Catalog:**
This consists of a product catalogue which will display the product list from where users can choose the product they want to buy.

* **Payment:**
This is a catalyst which can increase or decrease your sales ratio.  The motive here is to provide multiple payments options with ease in process and the tight layer of security.

* **Shopping Cart:**
A shopping cart is an essential feature for an e-commerce app where users will be able to add the product of their choices and place an order.

* **Customer Support:**
Customer support is an inevitable feature to run a successful business. For this, you can either leave your contact details within the app or you may integrate a chatbot which will work based on instant messaging.

Apart from this, if you’re planning to outgrow your competitors, here are some additional features you should have a look upon:

* ***Push Notifications:**
This is the single most key feature which is sought after by ecommerce giants. Plus, it works as a catalyst for the exclusive promotion and special offers.

* **Shipment Tracking:**
This feature tracks the status of the ordered shipment. Plus, it includes keeping the users updated by sending out SMS and email about the product delivery status.

* **Comparison Feature:**
This feature let users compare different product based on a fixed set of multiple values. For this, you will have to make another cart namely ‘Comparison Cart.’
