 Serverless Architecture- the term which has been added to the technology stack, a few years ago, is becoming a common use since the launch of AWS Lambda in 2014.

The evidence is- Raymond Camden, Serverless Developer Advocate quoting that serverless will become ‘less of a hot new thing’ and more of a ‘just another option’ and it is becoming a reality now. One of the main reason is that it provocatively illustrates one of the biggest headaches of the IT industry- server administration. In short, write your code and run your applications without provisioning or managing anything on the server side.

> But is the sweet reality is good as it is promised?

Well, let’s put this question on the test as we build an e-commerce app based upon serverless architecture using AWS stack.

Over the years, I’ve observed that many enterprises don’t know how to build such apps and ignore the massive benefits they have to offer due to insufficient knowledge. And that’s what I will be sharing with you in this post.

### Features for Building an MVP for a Serverless E-commerce Application

Before we jump onto architecting the tech stack for our ecommerce app, let’s discuss some of the basic features for our MVP.

* **User authentication and authorization:**
The first feature that comes to your mind while you think of an ecommerce app is user pool authentication & management. The aim here is to provide a seamless registration process while demanding the least possible information.

* **Product Catalog:**
This consists of a product catalogue which will display the product list from where users can choose the product they want to buy.

* **Payment:**
This is a catalyst which can increase or decrease your sales ratio.  The motive here is to provide multiple payments options with ease in process and the tight layer of security.

* **Shopping Cart:**
A shopping cart is an essential feature for an e-commerce app where users will be able to add the product of their choices and place an order.

* **Customer Support:**
Customer support is an inevitable feature to run a successful business. For this, you can either leave your contact details within the app or you may integrate a chatbot which will work based on instant messaging.

Apart from this, if you’re planning to outgrow your competitors, here are some additional features you should have a look upon:

* **Push Notifications:**
This is the single most key feature which is sought after by ecommerce giants. Plus, it works as a catalyst for the exclusive promotion and special offers.

* **Shipment Tracking:**
This feature tracks the status of the ordered shipment. Plus, it includes keeping the users updated by sending out SMS and email about the product delivery status.

* **Comparison Feature:**
This feature let users compare different product based on a fixed set of multiple values. For this, you will have to make another cart namely ‘Comparison Cart.’

### Getting Started With Monolithic First Approach
According to Martin Fowler, there are two common patterns which are followed while people approach towards microservice architecture. Here are they: 

* Most of the successful microservice stories start with a monolith which scales up to a level and then breaks up into microservices.

* Most of the development teams who started building their system with microservices have ended up in serious trouble.

When you begin building an application, there are a lot of uncertainties starting with how useful it will be for users. It may be hard to scale a system which is poorly designed but successful. However, that’s still a better option than being in the reverse situation.

And hence, it is always recommended to start with a simple version or MVP and test how well it is working out. And the add new functionalities in the form of microservices. Following this advice, here’s how what our MVP should consist of.

* Authorization — responsible for authorizing/managing a user
* Presentation — responsible for handling HTTP requests and responding with HTML or JSON/XML
* Business logic — the application’s business logic
* Database layer — data access objects responsible for accessing the database
* Application integration — integration with other services (e.g. via messaging or REST API). Or 
  integration with any other Data sources
* Notification module — responsible for sending email/push notifications whenever needed

### Why Serverless Architecture?
Six years ago, Walmart Canada failed on Black Fridays for two years in a row. It’s IT Department came across a multi-million dollar question since the ageing architecture started affecting their business negatively!

Monoliths might be fine for many systems but they are definitely not the best! And that’s where serverless architecture dominates the technology space.

**But what happened with Walmart?** Well, it couldn’t handle 6 million page views per minute and made it impossible to have a positive user experience. They had an architecture which was suitable for the internet of 2005, designed for desktops, laptops and monoliths.

That’s when they decided to re architect their legacy system to microservice based architecture and prepare themselves for the world by 2020, where there would be **4 Billion people connected to 25+ million apps available.**

**Sounds too good to be true? Wait! The results were:**

* Conversions were up by 20% literally overnight
* Mobile orders were up by 98% instantly
* No downtime on Black Friday or Boxing Day
* The operational savings were significant as well since the company moved off of its expensive     hardware onto commodity hardware
* They saved 40% of the computing power and experienced 20-50% cost savings overall

That was six years back. What we have now is to prepare ourselves till and beyond 2020. How? By building a serverless architecture based ecommerce mobile app! Here are a few more reasons to back my claims!

* **Enhanced scalability:**
Everyone expects their app to be the next Amazon. But if that happens, is it prepared to handle the load? Provisioning instance is a big risk- but so is being unprepared when success strikes. With serverless architecture, the sky is the limit and you don’t have to decide anything about scaling. One online program scaled to 50,000 users within six months without provisioning any servers.

* **Pay for what you use:**
Serverless technology saves money in terms of computing power and manpower both. First, you save by deleting all together with your infrastructure management staff and secondly, you pay only when your servers are running. No extra cost for idle time!

* **Decreased time to market:**
If your competitor got it first, you lose! That’s a simple economy of the consumer market. Serverless architecture allows developers to add new functionalities in hours and days instead of weeks and months. Few examples consist of apps that rely on third-party APIs for services like authentication (0Auth), social (Twitter), map (Mapbox), AI (IBM Watson) and more.

**Characteristics of Microservices**
Before we move further adding new functionalities to our MVP, let us understand what makes a good microservice.


* **Loose Coupling:**
One of the key features of what good microservices consists of is loose coupling. What this means is, a change in one service should not require a change in another. Because that’s the whole point of microservice, being able to change one service without needing to change anything to the other one.

For example, payment service and cart management should be developed as a separate service so that both can be scaled and maintained independently.

Apart from this, one service should know minimum things about the other services it is communicating with. This suggests keeping the number of calls with a different type of services to a minimum. If this fails, we will land up with potential performance problems on the top of tight coupling.

* **High Cohesion:**
The second key feature of a good microservice is high cohesion. This means to group microservices based on similar behaviour. Why this? Because if we want to change one behaviour, we want to do it as fast as we can without having to change the behaviour of any other region.

If it requires to make changes in lots of different places and making lots of services, it is not only slower but potentially risky! And that’s what we want to avoid at all. And hence, this recommends defining fine boundaries within your architecture which ensures that similar behaviour resides in one place while it couples with other boundaries as loosely as possible.

### Identifying the Bounded Contexts
We are developing a complex microservice architecture for a complex application which is going to be a set of loosely coupled bounded context i.e. business capabilities.

Microservices provides huge benefits but these benefits can be achieved only after a careful functional decomposition of the application into bounded contexts. The idea here is that any given application consists of multiple bounded contexts which can be defined as “a specific responsibility enforced by explicit boundaries” and consists of things which do not need to be communicated externally with other bounded contexts.

**How to decompose an application into business capabilities?**

By defining bounded contexts corresponding to business capabilities. These can be defined as something which does business in order to generate value. It normally corresponds to a business object,

* Product Management is responsible for product catalogue
* Notification management is responsible for email/sms notifications

Considering our case of a serverless ecommerce app, we are trying to introduce customer-centric services in order to meet our business goals of customer retention. Ecommerce is an inherently complex business domain. There are interrelationships among entities like users, products, reviews, payment, tracking, etc. But where do you start?
