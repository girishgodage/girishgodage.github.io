summary: What! Is this guy for real? Does he really think he can replace the front line of IT with pre-canned conversations?" I must admit, it's a bold statement. The IT Service Desk has been around for years and has been the foot in the door for most of us in the IT industry. It's the face of IT operations and plays an important role in ensuring an organisation's staff can perform to the best of their abilities. But what if we could take some of the repetitive tasks the service desk performs and automate them? Not only would we be saving on head count costs, we would be able to ensure correct policies and procedures are followed to uphold security and compliance. The aim of this blog is to provide a working example of the automation of one service desk scenario to show how easy and accessible the technology is, and how it can be applied to various use cases.

## The service desk with bots using Amazon Lex and Amazon Connect (Part 1)

What! Is this guy for real? Does he really think he can replace the front line of IT with pre-canned conversations?" I must admit, it's a bold statement. The IT Service Desk has been around for years and has been the foot in the door for most of us in the IT industry. It's the face of IT operations and plays an important role in ensuring an organisation's staff can perform to the best of their abilities. But what if we could take some of the repetitive tasks the service desk performs and automate them? Not only would we be saving on head count costs, we would be able to ensure correct policies and procedures are followed to uphold security and compliance. The aim of this blog is to provide a working example of the automation of one service desk scenario to show how easy and accessible the technology is, and how it can be applied to various use cases.

To make it easier to follow along, I've broken this blog up into a number of parts. Part 1 will focus on the high-level architecture for the scenario and begin creating the Lex chatbot.
