## AWS Lambda vs EC2- Comparison of AWS Compute Resources

Compare two of the widely used compute resources in software development: **AWS Lambda** vs **EC2**. Understand and analyze infrastructure management, performance and cost comparison. Get to know the evolution of AWS computing resources from EC2 to AWS Lambda and their potential use cases.

Cloud Foundry Foundation, a non-profit organisation that overlooks the open-source cloud computing projects, conducted a global survey recently consisting of 550 users. The survey results made it evident that 31% which is 169 of them are already using serverless architecture.

When further asked which platform they are using, 77% said AWS Lambda. FaaS services like AWS Lambda are becoming popular since they enable an organisation to build agile and scalable applications than server-based applications, for example, EC2.

EC2 requires management and provisioning of the environment. Each EC2 instances runs not just a full copy of an operating system, but a virtual copy of all the hardware that the operating system needs to run. In contrast, what AWS Lambda requires is enough system resources and dependencies to run a specific program.

Also, AWS Lambda enables you to create portable code blocks for easy development, testing and deployment. That's a winning trifecta!

If that's all there was to AWS Lambda vs EC2 then I'd be writing a death note for EC2. But, there's a lot more to it than just serverless-less/full. Let's discover.

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is an on-demand cloud computing resource offered in terms of function-as-a-service by AWS. Over time, AWS Lambda has changed the way we used to create, architect and run our applications.

The main difference between AWS Lambda vs EC2 (virtual server-based resources) is the responsibility of provisioning and use cases to name a few. AWS Lambda pricing is one of the biggest factors as well.

Before the emergence of agile solutions like AWS Lambda, operations teams had to allocate the resources based on the forecasting. They had to make sure that the computer and memory demands don't overflow the limits their system can handle.

With the computing resources like AWS Lambda, the computing resources can scale and descends automatically based on real-time demands. Presently, AWS Lambda supports multiple languages and can be used within an application in multiple manner or back-end as a service.

The architecture of applications built using functions like AWS Lambda is popularly called serverless architecture. AWS Lambda is a splendid example of how the overhead of the operation team is going to be a distant memory.

## What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a virtual cloud infrastructure service offered by AWS. This provides on-demand computing resources through which you can create powerful servers in the cloud.

The entire hardware of EC2 is fragmented into multiple resources which are offered in the form of instances which are scalable in terms of computing memory and processing power.

It also provides you with the flexible options to host your application onto more than one platforms with tight security for multi-model multi-tenant architecture. These instances can be accessed by the HTTP or HTTPS (API) which lets developers create applications just like an on-premise infrastructure.

With Amazon EC2, you have the facility of provisioning virtual machines as per your applications' requirements. Such facility is provided on a utility based subscription model where the user is billed as per their consumption of resources.

## An Evolution: From EC2 to AWS Lambda
With the onset of ***EC2*** as IaaS, AWS wanted to remove the overhead of managing the infrastructure. With the EC2, the time to allocate a server reduced to a fraction along with features like automatic scaling, scheduled provisioning and monitoring & alerting system powered by CloudWatch.

When EC2 was launched, it prevailed with the far more volatile environment than what it is now. Some of the initial issues were the sudden outage, multi-tenant model per machine, failure in scheduled provisioning and disappearance of virtual machines at all. Some of the popular sites that have been affected due to this are Reddit, Foursquare, Rapportive and Heroku.

Then came ***Elastic Beanstalk (EB)***, which provided all these facilities in a pretty package. EB is available to work with multiple languages and frameworks. With EB, developers can easily upload their code to the virtual machine itself through the AWS console.

Apart from that, EB directly spins up EC2 instances for you while automatically balancing the load and giving you the direct endpoint to use at the end. Even with this, developers can still log into the AWS console and manually configure or tweak the allocation of instances.

With the launch of IaaS, infrastructure management has been removed. It has benefited tremendously to the number of organisations. However, many of the promised advantages have not been fulfilled yet. ***For example, provisioning and capacity planning is still a major issue based on the manual forecast. To get ahead of this, FaaS was launched.***

Amazon released **AWS Lambda** which is available to work with multiple languages and frameworks. Like Elastic Beanstalk, you can upload your code packages directly to your functions. Unlike Elastic Beanstalk, the infrastructure is not available entirely for the development teams to tweak or manage.

However, the **scaling is fully automatic as per the requirements. As said, Lambdas use ECS and these containers are not available to configure manually**. On the other hand, Lambdas are exposed through API Gateway which functions as a URL router to your Lambdas.

## AWS Lambda vs EC2: Infrastructure Management

* ### Setup & Management Environment

    **AWS Lambda:** Whether you need to set up a multiple or single environment, you do not need to do much of a work. You are not required to spin up or provision containers or make them available for your applications, scaling is fully automated.

    AWS Lambda might not appeal to someone already working with an on-demand development environment with containers and orchestration in place.

    **Amazon EC2:** With EC2, setting up includes logging in via SSH and manually installing Apache and doing a git clone. Along with that, you need to install and configure all the required software in a manner which is automated and reproducible.

    For EC2, instances come in two options, first are standards ones which serve data roughly the same as our desktop hard drive and second, advanced provisioning which will serve data much faster. Comparatively, this is a lot of work.

* ### Security
    **AWS Lambda:** Serverless architecture abstracts away the patching and OS update manual work. With Lambda, you have the higher flexibility of workflows but at the same time, it increases the surface attack. What you need to consider is how to secure communication happening inside and outside your application.

    Another thing is that the granularity of functions is really high. With an increasing number of functions, monitoring becomes hard which in turn is a threat to decaying functions.

    However, vulnerability breaches are less likely to happen considering the stateless characteristic of the functions. Malicious agents grow over the time which isn't possible considering the statelessness. More to that, functions are automatically scalable which gives good protection against DDOS attacks. The protection is facilitated by auto-scaling functionality but it also increases your bill.

    **Amazon EC2:** With EC2, you'll have to take care of the security layer at the instance level. Security layer decides and controls the traffic allowed to communicate with each instance. Each instance can have multiple security layers which dictates the allowed inbound traffic through certain protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.

    Creating policies which will have correct permissions is tiresome and a work of trial and error. This is especially true when you're working with a growing team. Handling permissions for every specific business needs mean changing policies often and you end up increasing the unwanted granularity.

    Meanwhile, with Lambda, this is entirely taken care of by AWS along with OS patches and system maintenance.

    If we consider DDOS attacks, you'll either have to opt for other services of AWS Shield or you can do it manually by using ELB to scale under the attack or limiting the rate of requests/minute from a particular id. EC2 definitely have security groups and firewalls but unfortunately, those are not enough to monitor resource-based traffic monitoring.

    AWS Shield helps in automatically detect the type of AWS resource behind the elastic IP address and apply the relevant DDOS protections.

    AWS Lambda vs EC2: Performance Comparison
Timeout
AWS Lambda: As per the official documentation, AWS Lambda has the timeout of 300 seconds. This limits the type of tasks lambda can deal with. Long-running functions and complex tasks aren't a good fit.

Another problem is the time limit imposed by the API Gateway for the function to invoke which presently is 30 seconds. Even if you manage to architect a solution which handles timeout sufficiently, you'll have to constantly monitor and debug the issues when they inevitable happens.

Not all timeouts occur due to the 300 seconds limit. Some occur due to the bugs introduced or when you're dealing with communication over external servers which takes too much time or answers the functions with the wrong data.

Amazon EC2: In comparison to AWS Lambda vs EC2, the later one have pretty flexible options. You can definitely work with long running tasks since instances are available for different types of requirements with different configurations. This makes EC2 a better option over Lambda.

However, EC2 service is not error free. Connection timeout is an issue due to overlapping security group rules and unidentified user key by the server. Another common error happens when you're dealing with an insecure network over SSH.

This is especially applicable for newly created instances. For example, if you will try to SSH your new instance without waiting for its status checks to get complete, you will get an SSH timeout error. However, Lambda clearly lags while dealing with complex processing over EC2.

Dependencies
AWS Lambda: External libraries are inevitable for any project and it is true for AWS Lambda too. When you're dealing with heavy processing functions like image processing, video conversion, you're bound to have dependencies for the application.

However, Lambda comes with a limit. Uploading your function dependencies with the package itself seems to be the logical solution. But Lambda has a package size limit of 50 MB. Although, it gives you the option of downloading the dependencies once your function is executed from its "/tmp" file storage.

More to that, "/tmp" file storage has a limit of 512 MB. Also, the higher the number of dependencies, more time will be required to execute the function successfully.

Amazon EC2: Managing dependencies in EC2 isn't a big problem since it doesn't have constraints when it comes to temporary storage. Though what you should consider is the size of software packages and corresponding instance CPU. This is because your CPU may undergo burden if it's not configured for the same.

For example, the base of Amazon Linux Containers is already preloaded with many software packages that are required for executing the basic functionalities.

Scalability
AWS Lambda: Scalability is one of the major benefits of Lambda as most of the part is automatic and is handles by AWS. It scales dynamically in response to the increased traffic. At the time of the surge, it increases the number of concurrent executing functions. The number of concurrent limits is set to 500 as of now.

But scaling isn't as flawless as it is portrayed. In practical cases, we've faced errors during the creation of new Lambda functions. It is definitely great to have an automatic scaling system but it isn't much fun when you can't address these errors and work upon it.

For example, API Gateway timeout to invoke a lambda function is 30 seconds. And when you violate this limit, you'll see a spike in 5XX error being returned from API Gateway. The only option you have is to retry the request until you succeed.

Another example, Lambda depends on Amazon EC2 to provide Elastic Network Interface for your VPC-enabled Lambda function. And hence, your function's scalability also depends on EC2's rate limits as they scale. You need to check whether your VPC-enables functions are allowed 500 concurrent invocations per minute or not.

Amazon EC2: With EC2, everything is under your control. Everything in control means you will have to manually configure the scalability features unlike Lambda and that might not be the novel idea. However, the positive side is you can make your scalability an error-free process. Also, EC2 Auto Scaling groups are there to help you out.

These groups help you to ensure that you have sufficient amount of instances available to handle the load. Simply create the Auto Scaling groups, add the instances and specify the number of minimum and maximum instances in each group.

AWS ensures that your group never goes above and beyond the mentioned number of instances by automatically launching and terminating them.
