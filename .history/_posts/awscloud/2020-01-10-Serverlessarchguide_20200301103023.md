 Since the launch of serverless architecture in 2014, it is continuously redining the ways in which we develop and deploy our software products. One such revolutionary story surfaced while I was interacting with one of our client, a startup CTO.

“I recall how hard was it to build a prototype for production system which resulted in launching things even before they were ready, poorly managed continuous integration/development processes and bug fix systems that were created by an intern who left almost a year ago.

But now, due to serverless architecture, **I can spontaneously take up an idea**, transform into a scalable solution and outlast the business decision being taken to develop it!”

Being a startup CTO, this is a huge win when faster time-to-market is a key factor for thriving in the competing economy. However, serverless architecture brings more than just faster time-to-market and you’ll definitely need some help in getting started with this new concept.

Let’s get started and examine how serverless architecture is exactly defined!

### What is Serverless Architecture?
“Serverless computation is going to fundamentally not only change the economics of what is back-end computing, but it’s going to be the core of the future of distributed computing.” — **Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft**

> Methodology, mindset, culture–the heart of serverless is the approach. But taking the approach to its logical extreme yields technologies. This tech can be called serverless & they should become > the yardstick by which other technologies are measured (i.e., define the spectrum)

The world is still revolving around servers even with the rise of cloud computing. But it isn’t going to last for a longer time. Cloud apps are shifting into the serverless world and it will indeed bring about dramatic changes in how we create and distribute software and applications.

**Once Upon a Server Time**

Before the cloud-y days (pun intended), servers were one of the major parts, for developers,  when it came to building an application or software. You needed a budget, good plan, connect the dots, supply the power and provide them with a house.

You’d have to buy or lease the servers, arrange the power, supplies, cooling, cabling- and then construct them all up in a data centre or a colocation facility.

Over time, the colocation facilities started providing extra facilities like racks, power, internet access, etc. But it wasn’t sufficient.

And it still required a lot of detailed planning, a huge amount of time and, most importantly, money. Hence, **a shift was inevitable!**

**Entering the Cloud**
Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) came to the rescue!

Since the last 2 years, the way you do computing has been changed drastically. It’s not about ‘Why cloud?’ or ‘How cloud?’ anymore.

**IaaS served a perfect recipe for cost improvement**, agility and scalability with added spices of reliability and perfect architecture. (I’m now hungry, maybe!)

With a limitless supply of virtual machines, no upfront cost and a little bit of effort, developers were able to fire up servers with their choice of operating system and they’re off running.

Moreover, **the total cost of ownership has reduced dramatically.**

I remember buying servers at the cost of hundreds of dollars for my first company with the investment of a lot of efforts in their maintenance. For the second company, I leased the servers for years but still had to put a considerable amount of efforts.

For the third company, I leased them by month and for my current company, I’ve leased them by the hour, as per demand, on pennies.

But this was from the perspective of architecture and pricing. Anyways, the overall **concept of ‘application/software’** in the cloud is quickly evolving. It’s no longer about building on a web. It’s more about building a distributed system of loosely coupled components in the cloud.

The user apps and back-end data storage are still prevailing, but the processing is increasingly taking place asynchronously outside of an app framework. And hence, the worldview is increasingly around tasks and process flows, not applications and servers.

Moreover, their units of measures for compute cycles is in seconds and minutes, not hours. In short, **apps are becoming serverless**
