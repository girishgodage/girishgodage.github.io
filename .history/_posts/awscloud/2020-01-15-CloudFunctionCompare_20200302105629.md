## Comparing Serverless Providers

 Wondering which serverless provider is right for you? Read this blog to understand and analyze the comparison between AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs Google Cloud Functions. Get to know their current version and compare performance, security, pricing and scalability.

 When it comes to serverless providers, there are many popular opinions based on various biases. Yet, while choosing the serverless there are many things that go on than the surface picture.

Considering how critical this is for long-term success, platforms should be evaluated based on their functionalities and service integrations. The potential backlash in choosing a serverless platform is high. Some of them are vendor lock-in and data lock-in, as Patrick Debois, CTO at Zender, mentions in his tweet.

So how do you select the right serverless provider? The answer is in this article. Here we discuss the major serverless provider considering their technical empowerment which will help you to equally weigh the selection process directed towards your specific needs.

### Current Version:

As of today, AWS Lambda vs Azure Functions vs Google Cloud Functions all are production ready and generally available. Reflecting over the timeline, AWS Lambda became publicly available in early 2015, Azure Functions in late 2016 while Google Cloud Functions, just recently, in July 2018.

With such a big difference in their timeline, it is evident that AWS Lambda dominates the *serverless landscape* with the huge developer community and the wide spectrum of use cases. Moreover, it has advanced functionalities like edge processing and chaining.

Azure Functions supports the variety of supported runtime environment. The current approach of Azure is to provide a functional IDE in their portal to help you prototype and deploy functions.

When it comes to picking anyone out of this, the prerequisites and the evaluation criteria that you’ll employ will be unique to your organization. However, there are some common areas that these serverless providers fall into. Let’s discuss some of them.

### Language Support & Deployment

AWS Lambda currently has native support for code written in JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Java and C#, along with releasing support for Golang earlier this year. These wide choices of runtime environments and its versatility makes it the first choice for developers.

AWS Lambda provides API operations that you can use to create and update Lambda functions with the help of a deployment package uploaded to the console in a ZIP file or edited within the console itself.

> Dependency management aside the biggest barrier to entry is language runtime support. Most FaaS platforms only support a handful of language runtimes. AWS Lambda and Azure Functions being the exceptions as both platforms support most popular language runtimes.— Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) February 26, 2018

On the other hand, Azure Function supports C#, F#, Python, Java, Node.js, Python & PHP. Contrary to AWS Lambda, Azure Functions provides you with multiple options for deploying your function, such as GitHub, DropBox, Visual Studio, Kudu Console, Zip deployment and One Drive.

With Google Cloud Functions, your function execution varies by your chosen language. Currently, it supports Node.js 6, Node.js 7 and Python 3.7 with more to be supported soon. For deployment, you can choose either of these: CLI, Zip upload, inline web editor, Cloud Storage and Cloud Storage Repositories.

Truple.io is currently using AWS Lambda with Serverless Framework. According to its cloud architect, they used Azure Functions for 6 months but didn’t have a good experience. Eventually, they abandoned Azure Functions and moved to  Kubernetes. Here why,

*"AWS Lambda had most of the problems solved already for Node.Js. It has good scalability without any resource issues. AWS Lambda, I feel it works as it is promised. However, with C#, I did use it on AWS Lambda the week after it was released. However, it had some issues that were solved after almost 8 months."*
