 Since the launch of serverless architecture in 2014, it is continuously redining the ways in which we develop and deploy our software products. One such revolutionary story surfaced while I was interacting with one of our client, a startup CTO.

“I recall how hard was it to build a prototype for production system which resulted in launching things even before they were ready, poorly managed continuous integration/development processes and bug fix systems that were created by an intern who left almost a year ago.

But now, due to serverless architecture, **I can spontaneously take up an idea**, transform into a scalable solution and outlast the business decision being taken to develop it!”

Being a startup CTO, this is a huge win when faster time-to-market is a key factor for thriving in the competing economy. However, serverless architecture brings more than just faster time-to-market and you’ll definitely need some help in getting started with this new concept.

Let’s get started and examine how serverless architecture is exactly defined!

### What is Serverless Architecture?
“Serverless computation is going to fundamentally not only change the economics of what is back-end computing, but it’s going to be the core of the future of distributed computing.” — **Satya Nadella, CEO Microsoft**

> Methodology, mindset, culture–the heart of serverless is the approach. But taking the approach to its logical extreme yields technologies. This tech can be called serverless & they should become > the yardstick by which other technologies are measured (i.e., define the spectrum)

The world is still revolving around servers even with the rise of cloud computing. But it isn’t going to last for a longer time. Cloud apps are shifting into the serverless world and it will indeed bring about dramatic changes in how we create and distribute software and applications.

**Once Upon a Server Time**

Before the cloud-y days (pun intended), servers were one of the major parts, for developers,  when it came to building an application or software. You needed a budget, good plan, connect the dots, supply the power and provide them with a house.

You’d have to buy or lease the servers, arrange the power, supplies, cooling, cabling- and then construct them all up in a data centre or a colocation facility.

Over time, the colocation facilities started providing extra facilities like racks, power, internet access, etc. But it wasn’t sufficient.

And it still required a lot of detailed planning, a huge amount of time and, most importantly, money. Hence, **a shift was inevitable!**

**Entering the Cloud**
Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) came to the rescue!

Since the last 2 years, the way you do computing has been changed drastically. It’s not about ‘Why cloud?’ or ‘How cloud?’ anymore.

**IaaS served a perfect recipe for cost improvement**, agility and scalability with added spices of reliability and perfect architecture. (I’m now hungry, maybe!)

With a limitless supply of virtual machines, no upfront cost and a little bit of effort, developers were able to fire up servers with their choice of operating system and they’re off running.

Moreover, **the total cost of ownership has reduced dramatically.**

I remember buying servers at the cost of hundreds of dollars for my first company with the investment of a lot of efforts in their maintenance. For the second company, I leased the servers for years but still had to put a considerable amount of efforts.

For the third company, I leased them by month and for my current company, I’ve leased them by the hour, as per demand, on pennies.

But this was from the perspective of architecture and pricing. Anyways, the overall **concept of ‘application/software’** in the cloud is quickly evolving. It’s no longer about building on a web. It’s more about building a distributed system of loosely coupled components in the cloud.

The user apps and back-end data storage are still prevailing, but the processing is increasingly taking place asynchronously outside of an app framework. And hence, the worldview is increasingly around tasks and process flows, not applications and servers.

Moreover, their units of measures for compute cycles is in seconds and minutes, not hours. In short, **apps are becoming serverless**

**Thinking Serverless**
For the past 14 months or so, I’ve been working on serverless technology and let me tell you, it’s a very large break from the way we build our software/applications and deploy them.

But the phrase ‘serverless’ doesn’t mean servers are no longer involved. It just means that developers no longer have to worry about managing them. Without thinking much about their maintenance, computing resources get used as services.

Though, serverless can be understood as an amalgamation of two distinct points as follows:

**#1. BaaS**: First meaning of serverless could be taken as the **use of 3rd party services/applications (in the cloud) to handle the server-side logic and state**. For example, consider a mobile app with quite a broad ecosystem of cloud-based databases, authentication services, etc.

**#2. FaaS**: Second meaning of serverless could be taken as the **use of 3rd party stateless compute containers to handle the server-side logic**. These containers are event-triggered and may last for only one invocation i.e. ephemeral.

In this blog, you would be coming across FaaS quite frequently as it is a newer technology that is bringing about a significant change in the way we think about technical architecture and has been at the core of serverless.

Though, **both BaaS and FaaS are interrelated and overlapping**. For example, Auth0 started off as a BaaS ‘Authentication-as-a-Service’ but with Auth Webtask they have entered the FaaS space.

### FaaS: Function-as-a-Service
FaaS is a new and improved way to build and deploy your server-side software which is more focused around deploying individual functions or operations.

FaaS is where you hear a lot of buzz about serverless comes from. I remember one of our developer saying that **serverless is,in fact, FaaS**. If you are thinking the same, well let me correct you, you’re missing out the complete picture.

Anyways, **let’s get back to what is function-as-a-service about?**

**FaaS is inherently an event-driven approach**. But let’s understand it better by taking an example.

When we traditionally deploy a server-side application, we start with microservices. Digging deep, we start with host instance, usually a virtual machine instance or a container.

We then deploy our application within the host. If, in case, our host is a VM or a container, then out the application is an operating system process. Usually, our application contains the code for multiple interrelated operations as shown in the below figure.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/traditional-server-side-1.png)

FaaS changes this model of deployment. We would shift our focus from both host instance and application process of our model to the individual operations or functions that express our application’s logic. We upload those functions, one-by-one, to a vendor-supplied FaaS platform.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/faas-platform-1.png)

These **functions are not continuously active in a server** process though, sitting idle until they need to be run as they would be in a traditional system.

Instead, the **FaaS platform is configured in such a manner that it responds to a specific event for each operation**. When that event occurs, the vendor platform initiates the function and then calls it to the triggering event.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/faas-function-lifecycle-1-1.png)

Once the function has finished executing, the **FaaS platform is free to tear it down**. Alternatively, as an optimization, it might keep it for a while until there is another event to be processed.

As I said earlier, this is an event-driven approach. Moreover, FaaS vendor also integrates with various synchronous (HTTP API Gateway)  and asynchronous (hosted message) event sources apart from providing a platform to host and execute the code.

### What about Microservices?

I am sure you must be wondering where microservices would go?

They are here to stay! Do not worry!

This approach to digital transformation representing **monolithic —> microservices —> serverless** is driven by the need for greater agility and scalability. To keep up with the competition, the organizations need to update its technology stack quickly, eventually making the software a differentiating factor.

Thus microservices architecture emerged as a key **method of providing development teams with flexibility** and other benefits, such as the ability to deliver applications at warp speed using infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) environments.

The concept of this idea was to break the monolithic applications into smaller services each with its own business logic. With a monolithic architecture, a single faulty service can bring down the entire app server and all the services running on it.

While in a microservice each service runs in its own container and thus application architects can develop, manage and scale these services independently.

The microservices can be scaled and deployed separately and written in different programming languages. But a key decision many organizations face when deploying their microservices architecture is choosing between IaaS and PaaS environments.

Microservices involve source code management, a build server, code repository, image repository, cluster manager, container scheduler, dynamic service discovery, software load balancer and a cloud load balancer. It also needs a mature agile and DevOps team to support continuous delivery.

As explained earlier **FaaS takes the step further by making an application more granular to the level of functions and events**. Thus, it is pretty clear that the unit of work is getting smaller and smaller.

We’ve gone from monoliths to microservices to functions. FaaS also improves the shortcoming of PaaS model ie. scaling and friction between development and operations.

**Scaling a microservice hosted on PaaS is challenging and complex**. The architecture might have elements written in different programming languages, deployed across multiple clouds and on-premise locations, running on different containers.

When demand increases for the app, all the underlying components have to be coordinated to scale, or you have to be able to identify which individual elements need to scale to address the surge in demand.

Even if you set up your PaaS application to auto-scale you won’t be doing this to the level of individual requests unless you know the traffic trend. So a FaaS application is much more efficient when it comes to costs.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/complexity.png)

But still, there will be always space for both microservices and FaaS to co-exist because there are certain things which you can’t do with functions at all. For example, an API/Microservice will always be to respond faster since it can keep connections to databases and other things open and ready.

Moreover, one more thing to note here is that by **grouping a bundle of functions together behind an API gateway, you’ve created a microservice**. This shows that both of these can co-exist in a nice way.

This high-level flow remains the same as the traditional approach. The key difference is that, in case of a function, the container is created and destroyed by algorithms used in FaaS platforms and the operational team have no control over that.

And hence, it is here to stay!

But with ease of function and reduced cost comes increasing complexity about which we will discuss later in the blog.

### How does Serverless App Works?
Serverless might look like a bright sunny day but it isn’t that sunny after all. It has brought about a big difference when it comes to application architecture.

Moreover, **the change with serverless isn’t gradual**, but with a jolt. FaaS drives a totally different type of application architecture through a fundamentally event-driven model, a much more granular form of deployment.

So,

* **How does serverless app work in actual?**
* **What does serverless architecture look like?**
* **How is it different from non-serverless architecture?**

These are the questions that we’re going to tackle in this chapter. Let’s dive deeper and understand the serverless architecture and its working.

### Reference Application
Let’s make some assumptions about our reference application.

* **It is a multi-user app.**
* **It has a mobile-friendly user interface.**
* **User management and authentication are required.**

We’ve certainly overlooked some other features that you might expect in a basic app, but the point of this exercise is not to actually build an app but to compare a serverless application architecture with a legacy, non-serverless architecture.

### Monolithic Architecture
Given those requirements, a monolithic architecture for our app might look something like the below figure.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/monolithic-Architecture.png)

serverless architecture

* **A native mobile app for iOS or Android**
* **A backend is written in Java & HTML**
* **A relational database**

In this architecture, a mobile app is responsible for handling app interface and input from the user, but it delegates most actual logic to the backend. From the perspective of code, the mobile app is lightweight and quite simple. It uses HTTP to make a request to multiple API endpoints served by the backend Java application.

Authentication and user management are encapsulated with the Java application code. Moreover, it also interacts with the relational database in order to store user data.

### Why Change?
You might say, **“I am perfectly fine with this architecture as it meets all my requirements, so why just not stop there and call it a good?”**

To which I will reply that there are multiple challenges and operational pitfalls which I will discuss in this section to which you might relate. Go on!

In building this app, you’ll need to have hands-on expertise in iOS and Java, don’t you? Apart from that, you need to have good experience in configuring, deploying and operating Java application servers as well as a relational database. Moreover, think about their host systems, whether container-based or running directly on virtual or physical hardware?

We’ve not yet touched scalability, security or high availability, all of which are critical aspects of the modern production system. The bottom line- **all these complexities, at one point in time, will become friction** when you’ll be fixing bugs, adding features or trying to rapidly prototype new ideas.

And hence, you need a change!

### Serverless Architecture
A serverless architecture of our basic application would look something like the below figure.

![image info](/img/awscloud/3/user-flow-768x632.png)

According to this architecture, while the user interface will still remain a part of the native mobile app, user authentication and management will be handled by a BaaS service like AWS Cognito. These services can be called directly from the mobile app to handle user-facing tasks like registration and authentication.

Moreover, the same BaaS can be used by other backend components to retrieve user information.

With **user management and authentication now handle by BaaS**, the logic which was previously handled by backend Java application is simplified. You can use another amazing serverless component, AWS API Gateway, to handle routing HTTP requests between a mobile app and your backend in a secure and scalable manner.

Each distinct operation can be encapsulated in a function. A FaaS platform such as AWS Lambda takes each of these functions and runs them in parallel ‘containers’ that can be monitored and scaled separately.

Those backend FaaS functions can interact seamlessly with a NoSQL, BaaS database like AWS DynamoDB. In fact, one drastic change is that **we no longer store any session state within our server-side application code**, and instead will persist in NoSQL store.

While it may seem to you like a minute change but believe me, it will help you significantly with scaling.

###  What got better?
You might say, “There is no significant difference in terms of complexity and it has, in fact, more specific application components that our traditional monolithic architecture?”

To which I will reply that **the code we will write now will be solely focused on the logic of the app**. What’s more? Our components are now decoupled and separate, due to that, we can switch them or add new logic very fast without the inherent friction in the non-serverless architecture.

**Scaling, high availability and security are the areas all backed up with the serverless architecture**. This means that as the popularity of your app grows, you needn’t worry about renting more powerful servers, or failure in a database or troubleshoot a firewall configuration.

In short, **labour cost has reduced**, as well as, the risk and resources cost of running it. All of its constituent components will scale flexibly. What’s more? If you have an idea for a new feature, our lead time is highly decreased, hence, we can start getting feedback and work on it efficiently.

Pretty exciting, right?

We have more discussion on benefits and drawbacks of serverless. Stay tuned!

Before that, let’s discover more about serverless architecture through serverless architecture case study.

### Case Study: Unpacking Serverless Architecture

When PhotoVogue, part of Vogue Italia,  launched in 2011, it was woefully unprepared to become the next rags-to-riches online photography platform.

Within a year, **the popularity increased and skyrocketing traffic overwhelmed the Italy based company**. Moreover, the user experience went lethargic and its pre-existing backend limited the scalability.

Liking it to open-heart surgery, Marco Vigano, Head of Digital Development at Conde Nast Italia, was forced to perform an emergency migration from local server to AWS in just 3 months. **PhotoVogue’s quick switch to the serverless likely saved it from death-by-desertion after its homebrew server failed to keep the pace.**

This trend has further decreased time-to-market and delivers the scaling necessary for Uber, Pokemon Go, Airbnb, ‘Clash of Clans’ and numerous other apps characterised by large user bases and real-time data. With more than 4 million apps struggling for attention on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, developers are turning to serverless for a competitive advantage.

Sounds like a fascinating story? Let’s have a closer look!

### About the Platform

**PhotoVogue is an online photography platform**. It is a part of Vogue Italia which is owned by Conde Nast Italia. It allows upcoming photographers to showcase their work.

It also gives them the chance to have their photos published in Vogue or to be picked up by photography agencies. Each picture is curated by Vogue’s editorial staff and it ensures that highest quality photographs appear online

**The Challenge**
Let’s have a look at some of the key challenges faced by the PhotoVogue team.

* It currently showcases images from around **130,000 photographers** from around the world. This jumbo collection houses more than **400,000 images**, each of which can be **up to 50 MB in size**.
* With the growing demand, it failed to meet user demands. Moreover, the pre-existing IT infrastructure restricted the growth of the site.
* The need for providing better and faster experience to both photographers and editorial staff wasn’t feasible at all.

**The Solution**
Vigano identified AWS as the perfect cloud provider that suited the firm requirements which provided them with an amazing solution.

* It offered flexible scalability, ease of maintenance and cost-effectiveness than the pre-existing physical infrastructure that supported PhotoVogue.

* Presently, it uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to store all its photos where its ability to generate a URL enabled users to upload their photos really fast.

But, do they even use FaaS? Or any serverless components? Yes!
