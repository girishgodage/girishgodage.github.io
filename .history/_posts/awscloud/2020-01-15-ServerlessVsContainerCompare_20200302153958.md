summary:  Like most of the existing cloud application development trends, Serverless and Containers have been widely spoken-of and discussed among developers. Some feel that Serverless originated as an alternative to containerization and some feel serverless can be used with containers for application deployment. The difference between Serverless and Containerization is not limited to performance, but also applicable for longevity limitations, application scalability, time-of-deployment etc.

 It’s 2019 and like most of the ongoing trends of devops, going serverless or using containers for application deployment seem to be a common point of debate among all new kids (pun intended!) on the block right now! And we still feel it’s not going to end anytime soon.

However, Is the Serverless vs Container comparison popular just because some cloud enthusiasts feel that serverless computing is a replacement for containers? OR Is it because some people feel that serverless is just another technology that can be used inside containers? 

In this article, we’ll compare both these technologies and try to find out which one (if any!) is better. What are the common and distinct qualities? Which one is suitable for what application use case? But first, let’s start with some background.
