 Learn how to build an ecommerce app using serverless architecture (reference architecture added). Start with an MVP and design the microservices using AWS Lambda functions to reap the benefits of event-driven architecture.

 Serverless Architecture- the term which has been added to the technology stack, a few years ago, is becoming a common use since the launch of AWS Lambda in 2014.

The evidence is- Raymond Camden, Serverless Developer Advocate quoting that serverless will become ‘less of a hot new thing’ and more of a ‘just another option’ and it is becoming a reality now. One of the main reason is that it provocatively illustrates one of the biggest headaches of the IT industry- server administration. In short, write your code and run your applications without provisioning or managing anything on the server side.

Well, let’s put this question on the test as we build an e-commerce app based upon serverless architecture using AWS stack.
