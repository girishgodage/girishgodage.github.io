## 6 Multi-Cloud Management Platforms, Challenges and Best Practices

Multi-cloud management is one of the biggest challenges for enterprises. It can be difficult and often requires the use of third-party tools. This blog consists of some popular multi-cloud management tools and key features you should look while selecting the tool.

It is evident that multi-cloud strategy eliminates crucial challenges in cloud computing like vendor lock-in, latency, and higher cost. In addition, organizations can leverage vendors' unique capabilities in artificial intelligence, serverless computing or augmented reality.

However, building applications that are truly built on multi-cloud architecture are challenging. The reason is that the different clouds and on-premises resources use different APIs and management interfaces. 

For example, ***Amazon S3 obviously supports the Amazon S3 API, but Azure Blob Storage and Google Cloud Storage do not. Dealing with multiple APIs and management interfaces has always been anathema for application developers who want to avoid the vendor lock-in of a single API, as well as the added development, support, and time costs associated with supporting multiple APIs.***

With proper multi-cloud management, organizations can deal with multi-cloud challenges. According to Judith Hurwitz, CEO of Hurwitz & Associates:

> The real value of multi-cloud management is the opportunity to mix and match — to get the most cost-effective services, the most innovative services — and to tailor those services to the problem at hand and to changing business demands.

There are many platforms available to manage multiple cloud providers via a single interface. These tools include cloud management platforms (CMPs), cloud services brokers (CSBs), and other tools that provide an abstraction layer between two or more public-cloud providers. There are also tools that manage, monitor, and utilize those services. 

To help you choose the right multi-cloud management platform, I've divided the blog into the following parts:

## What is Multi-cloud Management?

Multi-cloud management is a practice of developing consistent workflows for managing infrastructure provisioning (set-up/tear-down), security, connectivity, and service discovery across cloud platforms. A well defined multi-cloud management provides the visibility required to prevent challenges that lead to a complex multi-cloud architecture.

A well-defined cloud management strategy helps organizations achieve the following primary goals.

  1. **Self-service capabilities**: Self-service capabilities eliminate the traditional processes related to IT resource provisioning. 
  2. **Workflow automation**: Cloud management enables workflow automation. Organizations can take actionable steps needed to create and manage computing instances, without human intervention.
  3. Cloud analysis: By doing cloud analysis and monitoring, organizations can use the best available services according to requirements. Also, with the use of metrics, organizations can change cloud providers or migrate workloads from the public to private clouds if they don't get optimal performance.
   
## Challenges in Multi-Cloud Management
### Cost
Many companies suffer from the large expenses of using cloud services due to poor multi-cloud management. In multi-cloud, organizations use multiple services from different cloud providers. Many times, it becomes difficult to utilize all the services as per demand and hence companies have to pay for the services which have been not used.
