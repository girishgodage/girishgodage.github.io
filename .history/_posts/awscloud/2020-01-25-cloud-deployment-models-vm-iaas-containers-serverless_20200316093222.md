When companies talk about moving to the cloud, it is a general assumption that they are bringing their on-premise workload to the public cloud and not switching clouds. However, GitLab, a startup famous for providing developers tools, announced earlier this year that they are abandoning Microsoft Azure and moving to Google Cloud Platform, as mentioned in the official GitLab statement.

This step took place because GitLab wanted to adopt cloud-native practices with the best use of microservices and containers. The same approach used by GitLab is becoming a critical factor for modern software development. Also, Kubernetes turned out their preferable choice since it allows elastic scaling from a couple of users to millions.

GitLab is just not one example! There are many organizations who switch their cloud deployment models amid the requirements demanded by the modern application users.

You could be also one of the people who is reconsidering their public cloud choices. Maybe because your needs have changed? Or you could be one wondering to re-architect an application? The possibilities are endless.
