### Build a Scalable Application

 Scalability of an application is equally important as its features and user interface. It becomes even more important if your app is going to serve more than a million users in the future. In this blog, you will learn how to scale your app up to 1 million users on AWS.

 Suppose you’ve built a web application and started getting few customers. After some feedback and suggestions, you are ready with the full-fledged product. Now, your marketing team shares your app on product hunt to acquire new customers. Suddenly, thousands of visitors are using your app and at one point they are unable to use your app.

You’ve tested your app and it is working fine. So what happened?

**“This is not a bug but a problem of scalability. Your cloud architecture is not designed to scale with increasing load.”**

I’ve seen many companies which usually focus more on features and less on scalability. Creating applications that are both resilient and scalable is an essential part of any application architecture. In this blog, you will learn how to build highly scalable web application architecture that can scale with increasing load. 

### What is a Scalable Application?
Scalability refers to the ability of a system to give a reasonable performance under growing demands (This can be larger data-sets, higher request rates, the combination of size and velocity, etc). It should work well with 1 user or 1 million users and handles spikes in traffic automatically. By adding and removing the resources only when needed, scalable apps consume only the resources necessary to meet demand.

When talking about scalability in cloud computing, you will often hear about two main ways of scaling – horizontal or vertical. Let’s look deeper into these terms.

#### Vertical scaling (Scaling Up)
Scaling up or vertical scaling refers to resource maximization of a single unit to expand its ability to handle the increasing load. In hardware terms, this includes adding processing power and memory to the physical machine running the server. In software terms, scaling up may include optimizing algorithms and application code.
