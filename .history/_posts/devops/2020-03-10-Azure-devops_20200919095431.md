##  AZURE DEVOPS – MANAGE YOUR APPLICATION LIFECYCLE IN CLOUD

**Application lifecycle management (ALM)** is the product lifecycle management of computer programs.

It encompasses **requirements management**, **software architecture**, **computer programming**, **software testing**, **software maintenance**, **change management**, **continuous integration**, **project management**, and **release management**.

An **ALM tool** should have the capability to maintain all the aspects of a software lifecycle, such as <span style="background-color: #FFFFFF">**capturing the ideas, users requirement, planning of work, maintaining source code, deploying code using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)**</span>. It should also provide real time project insights to the key stake holders of a project. We can think of an ALM software as one stop shop for a software project/product management as a whole.

In this post we will take a look at **Microsoft’s Azure DevOps offering**, it’s capability as an ALM solution and will see how you can use it for your ALM journey.
