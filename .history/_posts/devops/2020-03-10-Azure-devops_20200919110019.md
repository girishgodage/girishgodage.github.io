##  AZURE DEVOPS – MANAGE YOUR APPLICATION LIFECYCLE IN CLOUD

**Application lifecycle management (ALM)** is the product lifecycle management of computer programs.

It encompasses **requirements management**, **software architecture**, **computer programming**, **software testing**, **software maintenance**, **change management**, **continuous integration**, **project management**, and **release management**.

An **ALM tool** should have the capability to maintain all the aspects of a software lifecycle, such as <span style="background-color: #2197CB">**capturing the ideas, users requirement, planning of work, maintaining source code, deploying code using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)**</span>. It should also provide real time project insights to the key stake holders of a project. We can think of an ALM software as one stop shop for a software project/product management as a whole.

In this post we will take a look at **Microsoft’s Azure DevOps offering**, it’s capability as an ALM solution and will see how you can use it for your ALM journey.

## What is Azure DevOps?

In a single sentence, Azure DevOps is a suite of offering in the cloud that you need to **build your software product/project from beginning to end**.

**Azure DevOps**, formerly known as Visual Studio Team System (VSTS). It helps you to plan your project, manage source code in repositories like *Git, TFVC, Subversion, GitHub and deploys the code through the CI/CD pipeline system to cloud or in on-premise resources*. 

Additionally it gives a **collaborative platform** for **developers, business users and test engineers, project managers** under one umbrella to **real time tracking of work** and **quick shipment** of the product.

## Six pillars of Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps has six major pillars which helped it to shape as complete ALM offering in the the cloud. Let’s briefly look into the the major pillars of Azure DevOps

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzureBoard.png "Azure Boards")**Azure Boards** is a place to **manage and plan** all of your work.** All ideas** and **business requirements** for your software can be **captured here**. You can create **epics**, **features**, **user stories** and then **estimate them** and **plan capacity** of your *team members* and start the **sprint**.

Additionally you can have a real time view of the work item progression in **Kanban boards**, **sprint burn down charts**. 

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzureRepos.png "Azure Repos")**Azure Repos**  supports various source control system like *Azure Git, Public GitHub, GitHub Enterprise,  Microsoft’s own Team foundation version control (TFVC), External Git*. 

You can choose any one of the repositories for your choice for software development and source code. Once development is done developers can create a pull request with their changes, send it for code review and take part of a collaborative development environment.

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzurePipeline.png "Azure Pipeline")**Azure Pipelines**  are used for **continuous integration** and **continuous delivery  (CI/CD)** of your code. It allows you to **ship your code faster**. 

Once your code is **developed and committed** to the repos, a **build** gets triggered in the **build pipeline**.<span style="background-color: #2197CB"> This build pipeline gets the **latest code from the repos**, builds them in the build agent. On a successful build, the *build artifacts gets published using Release pipeline in your targeted deployment environment*.</span> 

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzureTestPlans.png "Azure Test Plans")**Azure Test Plans**  is for planning and executing your manual, automated  and load test cases. Once the build is succeeded test engineers can run a set of tests on the build for verification and validation of the desired functionality. And they can raise and log any defects or observation on failure  of any of the planned test scenarios in the Azure Boards.

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzureArtifacts.png "Azure Artifacts")**Azure Artifacts**  manages your private NuGet, npm, Maven packages in a private feed. You can integrate this feed in your favourite IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and restore the packages from this feed while development. Additionally you can integrate this feed in the build pipeline and restore packages from this private repository. Azure Artifacts helps a lot where there are a lot of shared common packages in use in the application and you want to control standards, version of those cross cutting atrifacts.

![Image](/img/devops/2/AzureOverview.png "Azure Overview")**Azure Overview**  gives real time insights of the project  such as teams velocity, CI/CD results, number of defects raised vs solved at any point of time to name a few. Executive dashboards can be created with inbuilt capability of it. These dashboard helps greatly for executive status reporting with risk and quality matrices.
