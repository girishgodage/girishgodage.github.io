### What is Database Migration? Understanding Needs and Challenges

  Adopting emerging technologies have helped businesses in leveraging their overall performance. Database Migration is one of those. If you are planning a migration, what are the challenges involved during database migration? What is the need to do it? Let me walk you through the essentialities before performing database migration.

 Applications using database would require updates over time to support new features or fix the scaling problem with the queries. If you are also planning for database migration, let me tell you one thing. Database migration can be one of the easiest tasks if the application size is small. But, for bigger applications, you need to write migrations, which seems a bit tedious. 

For instance, Coursera with a then user base of about 1.6 million users migrated the database, from MongoDB to MySQL servers running on Amazon RDS, without any downtime – scheduled or unscheduled. As said by **Frank Chen**, who was involved in the migration process, ***"We did parallel writes into both MongoDB and MySQL for a time, running a migration script to migrate the old data into MySQL servers. Once this was done, we flipped the switch to read data from both MySQL and MongoDB in order to ensure consistency. We then finally made a switch to read from MySQL as our primary database."*** 

Well, the time to migrate a database depends on the complexity of the database.  Database migration can be considered as part of application modernization. It can be a challenging task to modernize the application as there are many moving parts and you need to understand all of them. Even if you are thorough with your source database engine, if you switch engines you need to know the nitty-gritty of the target database engine. Or rather, need to be an expert in the target database engine. 

Some popular database migration service providers allow you to migrate data from the source database to the target database. During the migration process, the service tracks changes that are being made on the source database. This is done so that the two databases remain synced – changes done in the source can be applied to the target database. There is no need for the source and the target database to be of the same engine type."
