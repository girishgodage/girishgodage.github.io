### Amazon DynamoDB – A Complete Guide

DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon. These days, databases have become the backbone for any company irrespective of how big they are. Traditional database systems which were initially used, are not the go-to solution today because of the dynamic change in requirements and type of data procured. In this Amazon DynamoDB tutorial, I will be discussing the new and fast way of storing and retrieving data using DynamoDB.

In this Amazon DynamoDB tutorial, I will be discussing the following topics:

* **What Is DynamoDB?**
* **Terminologies Associated With DynamoDB**
* **Accessing Amazon DynamoDB**
* **Features Of DynamoDB**
* **DynamoDB API**
* **DynamoDB: Case Studies**
* **Demo: Creating, Inserting And Querying A Table In DynamoDB**

### What Is DynamoDB?

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL service that works on key-value pair and other data structure documents provided by Amazon. It requires only a primary key and doesn't require a schema to create a table. It can store any amount of data and serve any amount of traffic. With DyanmoDB, you can expect a good performance even when it scales up. It is a very simple and small API that follows key-value method to store, access and perform advanced data retrieval.

DynamoDB comprises of three fundamental units known as table, attribute, and items. A table holds a set of items, an attribute is the simplest element that stores data without any further division and item holds a set of attributes.

Now that you know what is DynamoDB, let's move further in this Amazon DynamoDB tutorial and introduce you to the terms used here.


### Terminologies Associated With DynamoDB
Here with DynamoDB, everything is kept simple, the terms used with DynamoDB are easy to understand which makes it unique from the rest of the Database services. The terms used are as follows:

* **Table, Items, and Attributes**
  1. A **table** can be visualized as a group of items. Taking an example of Employee records, *you will have Employee Name, Employee ID, Address and Phone Number all such items will be stored in a table.*
  2. An **item** is a set of attributes in a table. You can also understand an item as a set of attributes that can uniquely define your entry in a table. For example, *an item in Employee records will identify a single employee.*
  3. An **attribute** is a single field that is attached to an item. E.g. *Employee Name*.
   
* **Primary Key**
  
  A primary key is a unique attribute that is necessary while creating a table, it cannot be null at any given point. Hence, while inserting an item into the table, a primary key attribute is a must. E.g. *Employee ID is the primary key for the table Employee records. Two items cannot have a similar primary key*. DynamoDB supports two types of Primary key.

  * **Simple Primary Key**
    A simple primary key is also known as Partition key, this is basically a single attribute. DynamoDB uses Partition key's value to distinguish items in a table. E.g. *Employee ID in Employee records table.*

  * **Composite Primary Key**
    A composite primary key is also known as Partition key and Sort key. This type of key is generally made up of two items. **The primary component is the Partition key and the secondary component is the Sort key**. E.g.* Car Details table with Brand name and Model number as a composite primary key*.

* **Secondary Index**  
A secondary index can be understood as the attribute that lets you query the data, with or without the help of a Primary key. DynamoDB has these secondary indexes that help you achieve this additional access.

* **DynamoDB Streams**
This is an additional/optional feature provided by DynamoDB to keep a track of data modification events in a table. Here, each event is represented by a stream record and if this service is enabled, then you get a new event every time when there is a new item created, an item is updated or an item is deleted.

These are the different terms used, without any further delay let's proceed with the DynamoDB tutorial and find out how to access a table.

### Accessing Amazon DynamoDB
Accessing DynamoDB is very easy and can be done using the following methods:

* Console
  You can access DynamoDB simply by clicking here.
* CLI(Command Line Interface)
  Using CLI, you can simply open your command prompt and type the relevant commands and access the table. For more details, click here.
* Using API
  Using AWS SDKs you can make the most of DynamoDB. AWS SDK supports a variety of languages like Java, JavaScript, .NET, Python, PHP etc. For more details, click here.
