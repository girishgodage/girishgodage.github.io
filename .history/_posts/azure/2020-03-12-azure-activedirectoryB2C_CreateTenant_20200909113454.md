>## Create an Azure AD B2C tenant

Before your applications can interact with Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), **they must be registered in a tenant that you manage**.

In this article, you learn how to:

* Create an Azure AD B2C tenant
* Link your tenant to your subscription
* Switch to the directory containing your Azure AD B2C tenant
* Add the Azure AD B2C resource as a Favorite in the Azure portal

## Prerequisites

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Create an Azure AD B2C tenant

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Sign in with an Azure account that's been assigned at least the [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) role within the subscription or a resource group within the subscription.

2. Select the directory that contains your subscription.

In the Azure portal toolbar, select the Directory + Subscription icon, and then select the directory that contains your subscription. This directory is different from the one that will contain your Azure AD B2C tenant.
