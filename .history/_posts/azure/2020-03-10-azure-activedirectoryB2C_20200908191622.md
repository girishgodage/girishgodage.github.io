## What is Azure Active Directory B2C?

 **Azure Active Directory B2C** provides business-to-customer **identity as a service**. Your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications and APIs.

**Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)** is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of **supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day**. 
It takes care of the **scaling** and **safety** of the *authentication platform*, monitoring and automatically handling threats like **denial-of-service, password spray, or brute force attacks**.

## Custom-branded identity solution

 Azure AD B2C is a **white-label authentication solution**. You can customize the entire user experience with your brand so that it blends seamlessly with your web and mobile applications.

**Customize every page displayed by Azure AD B2C when your users sign up, sign in, and modify their profile information**. Customize the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in your user journeys so that the Azure AD B2C experience **looks and feels like it's a native part of your application**.

## Single sign-on access with a user-provided identity

Azure AD B2C uses standards-based authentication protocols including **OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML**. It integrates with most modern applications and commercial off-the-shelf software.

By serving as the **central authentication authority** for your ***web applications, mobile apps, and API***s, Azure AD B2C enables you to build a single **sign-on (SSO) solution** for them all. Centralize the collection of **user profile and preference information**, and *capture detailed analytics* about **sign-in behavior** and **sign-up conversion**.

## Integrate with external user stores

Azure AD B2C provides a directory that **can hold 100 custom attributes per user**. However, you can also **integrate with external systems**. For example, use Azure AD B2C for **authentication**, but delegate to an external **customer relationship management (CRM) ** or **customer loyalty database** as the source of truth for customer data.

Another external user store scenario is to have Azure AD B2C handle the authentication for your application, but **integrate with an external system that stores user profile or personal data**. For example, to satisfy data residency requirements like **regional or on-premises data** storage policies.

Azure AD B2C can facilitate **collecting the information from the user during registration or profile editing**, then *hand that data off to the external system*. Then, during future **authentications**, Azure AD B2C can retrieve the data from the external system and, if needed, include it as a part of the authentication token response it sends to your application.

## Progressive profiling

Another user journey option includes **progressive profiling**. Progressive profiling allows your **customers to quickly complete their first transaction by collecting a minimal amount of information**. Then, gradually collect more profile data from the customer on future sign-ins.

> **Power of Microsoft Azure**, such as security, load  balancing, autoscaling, and automated management.

> **DevOps capabilities**, such as **continuous deployment** from *Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources*, **package management**, **staging environments**, **custom domain**, and **SSL certificates**

With **App Service**, **you pay for the Azure compute resources you use**. The compute resources you use is determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on.

## Why use App Service?

Here are some key features of App Service:

* **Multiple languages and frameworks** - App Service has first-class support for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. You can also **run PowerShell and other scripts or executables as background services**.
  
* **DevOps optimization** - Set up **continuous integration and deployment** with Azure DevOps, GitHub, BitBucket, Docker Hub, or Azure Container Registry. Promote updates through **test and staging environments**. Manage your apps in App Service by using **Azure PowerShell** or the **cross-platform command-line interface (CLI)**.
* **Global scale with high availability** - Scale **up** or **out** manually or automatically. Host your apps anywhere in Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure, and the App Service **SLA** promises high availability.
* **Connections to SaaS platforms and on-premises data** - Choose from more than 50 **connectors** for enterprise systems (such as SAP), SaaS services (such as Salesforce), and internet services (such as Facebook). Access on-premises data using **Hybrid Connections** and **Azure Virtual Networks**.
* **Security and compliance** - App Service is **ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant**. Authenticate users with **Azure Active Directory** or with social login (**Google**, **Facebook**, **Twitter**, and **Microsoft**). Create **IP address restrictions** and **manage service identities**.
* **Application templates** - Choose from an extensive list of application templates in the **Azure Marketplace**, such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
* **Visual Studio integration** - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, and debugging.
* **API and mobile features** - App Service provides turn-key CORS support for RESTful API scenarios, and simplifies mobile app scenarios by enabling authentication, offline data sync, push notifications, and more.
* **Serverless code** - Run a code snippet or script on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure, and pay only for the compute time your code actually uses (see [Azure Functions](/azure/azure-functions/)).

Besides App Service, Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting websites and web applications. For most scenarios, App Service is the best choice.  For microservice architecture, consider **Service Fabric**. If you need more control over the VMs that your code runs on, consider **Azure Virtual Machines**.
