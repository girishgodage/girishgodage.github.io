### Azure Building Blocks â€“ IaC Tool

 Whilst researching Infrastructure as Code alternatives to Azure Resource Manager templates I stumbled across the Azure Building Blocks (AZBB) tool. It's not widely adopted and you'll see why later on this in blog.

 Because I'm not keen on authoring large JSON files (aka ARM templates) for IaC I'm going to put Azure Building Blocks to the test with a simple Hub & Spoke VNET deployment. Later on I'll also demonstrate the same deployment using an AzureCLI script â€“ my current preferred alternative to ARM Templates â€“ so you'll see the differences.

FYI â€“ AZBB currently supports the following resource types:

* **Virtual Networks**
* **Virtual Machines (including load balancers)**
* **Virtual Machine Extensions**
* **Route Tables**
* **Network Security Groups**
* **Virtual Network Gateways**
* **Virtual Network Connection**

***Note**: Before writing this blog I also tested deploying VMs to Azure using the AZBB tool and ran into an issue which turned out to be a blocker for further tests. You can view open/closed AZBB project issues here.*

## What is AZBB?

The Azure Building Blocks project is a command line tool and set of Azure Resource Manager templates designed to simplify deployment of Azure resources. Users author a set of simplified parameters to specify settings for Azure resources, and the command line tool merges these parameters with best practice defaults to produce a set of final parameter files that can be deployed with the Azure Resource Manager templates â€“ source: Microsoft

Based on the above description â€“ a key advantage behind using Azure Building Blocks is to save you time by merging your JSON parameter files with it's pre-defined ARM templates as part of it's deployment flow to Azure.

These pre-defined ARM templates also apply some best-practice defaults such as:

* **Enables diagnostics on all VMs**
* **Deploys the VMs in an availability set**
* **All VM disks are managed**
* **OS is latest Windows Server 2016 image**
* **Public IP created for each VM**

Unfortunately these best-practice defaults are not easily found â€“ so to discover what defaults are applied (and to override them when needed) have a look at the reference wiki for each supported resource e.g. https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/wiki/Virtual-Machines

## Demo Deployment
For this demo I'm deploying a basic HUB/SPOKE Virtual Network architecture common with production Azure environments where the Hub VNET may contain shared services such as a Firewall, Domain Controllers, JumpBoxes, and an ExpressRoute Gateway.

This deployment is sourced from premade AZBB parameter files publicly available here: https://github.com/mspnp/template-building-blocks/tree/master/scenarios

## Step 1 â€“ Install NPM/Node.js
To run the AZBB tool locally we first need to install NPM/Nodejs so on my local machine I downloaded/ran the Windows x64 client installer from https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm.

Then I ran npm install from a VSCode terminal to setup Azure Building Blocks and then azbb to test the tool was installed correctly.

```nodejs

npm install -g @mspnp/azure-building-blocks 

azbb

```

Seeing this screen is a good sign ðŸ™‚
