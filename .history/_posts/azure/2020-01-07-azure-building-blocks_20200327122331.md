### Azure Building Blocks – IaC Tool

 Whilst researching Infrastructure as Code alternatives to Azure Resource Manager templates I stumbled across the Azure Building Blocks (AZBB) tool. It's not widely adopted and you'll see why later on this in blog.

 Because I'm not keen on authoring large JSON files (aka ARM templates) for IaC I'm going to put Azure Building Blocks to the test with a simple Hub & Spoke VNET deployment. Later on I'll also demonstrate the same deployment using an AzureCLI script – my current preferred alternative to ARM Templates – so you'll see the differences.

FYI – AZBB currently supports the following resource types:

* **Virtual Networks**
* **Virtual Machines (including load balancers)**
* **Virtual Machine Extensions**
* **Route Tables**
* **Network Security Groups**
* **Virtual Network Gateways**
* **Virtual Network Connection**

***Note**: Before writing this blog I also tested deploying VMs to Azure using the AZBB tool and ran into an issue which turned out to be a blocker for further tests. You can view open/closed AZBB project issues here.*
