>## What is Azure Active Directory B2C?

 **Azure Active Directory B2C** provides business-to-customer **identity as a service**. Your customers use their preferred social, enterprise, or local account identities to get single sign-on access to your applications and APIs.

**Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C)** is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of **supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day**. 
It takes care of the **scaling** and **safety** of the *authentication platform*, monitoring and automatically handling threats like **denial-of-service, password spray, or brute force attacks**.

## Custom-branded identity solution

 Azure AD B2C is a **white-label authentication solution**. You can customize the entire user experience with your brand so that it blends seamlessly with your web and mobile applications.

**Customize every page displayed by Azure AD B2C when your users sign up, sign in, and modify their profile information**. Customize the **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in your user journeys so that the Azure AD B2C experience **looks and feels like it's a native part of your application**.

## Single sign-on access with a user-provided identity

Azure AD B2C uses standards-based authentication protocols including **OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML**. It integrates with most modern applications and commercial off-the-shelf software.

By serving as the **central authentication authority** for your ***web applications, mobile apps, and API***s, Azure AD B2C enables you to build a single **sign-on (SSO) solution** for them all. Centralize the collection of **user profile and preference information**, and *capture detailed analytics* about **sign-in behavior** and **sign-up conversion**.

## Integrate with external user stores

Azure AD B2C provides a directory that **can hold 100 custom attributes per user**. However, you can also **integrate with external systems**. For example, use Azure AD B2C for **authentication**, but delegate to an external **customer relationship management (CRM) ** or **customer loyalty database** as the source of truth for customer data.

Another external user store scenario is to have Azure AD B2C handle the authentication for your application, but **integrate with an external system that stores user profile or personal data**. For example, to satisfy data residency requirements like **regional or on-premises data** storage policies.

Azure AD B2C can facilitate **collecting the information from the user during registration or profile editing**, then *hand that data off to the external system*. Then, during future **authentications**, Azure AD B2C can retrieve the data from the external system and, if needed, include it as a part of the authentication token response it sends to your application.

## Progressive profiling

Another user journey option includes **progressive profiling**. Progressive profiling allows your **customers to quickly complete their first transaction by collecting a minimal amount of information**. Then, gradually collect more profile data from the customer on future sign-ins.

## Third-party identity verification and proofing

Use Azure AD B2C to facilitate *identity verification and proofing by collecting user data, then passing it to a third party system to perform validation, trust scoring, and approval for user account creation*.

These are just some of the things you can do with Azure AD B2C as your business-to-customer identity platform.

> ## Technical and feature overview of Azure Active Directory B2C

Here are the **primary resources** you work with in the service, its features, and how these enable you to provide a fully custom identity experience for your customers in your applications.

## Azure AD B2C tenant

In Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C), **a tenant** represents **your organization** and is a **directory of users**. *Each Azure AD B2C tenant is distinct and separate from other Azure AD B2C tenants*. An Azure AD B2C tenant is different than an Azure Active Directory tenant, which you may already have.

The primary resources you work with in an Azure AD B2C tenant are:

* **Directory** - The directory is where Azure AD B2C **stores** your **users' credentials** and **profile data**, as well as your **application registrations**.
  
* **Application registrations** - You **register your web, mobile, and native applications** with Azure AD B2C to **enable identity management**. Also, **any APIs** you want to protect with Azure AD B2C.
* **User flows and custom policies** - The built-in **(user flows)** and fully customizable **(custom policies)** identity experiences for your applications.
    * Use user flows for **quick configuration and enablement of common identity tasks like sign up, sign in, and profile editing**.
    * Use **custom policies** to enable user experiences not only for the **common identity tasks**, but also for crafting support for **complex identity workflows** unique to your organization, customers, employees, partners, and citizens.
* **Identity providers** - Federation settings for:
    * **Social identity** providers like Facebook, LinkedIn, or Twitter that you want to support in your applications.
    * **External identity** providers that support standard identity protocols like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and more.
    * **Local accounts** that enable users to sign up and sign in with a username (or email address or other ID) and password.
* **Keys** - Add and manage encryption keys for signing and validating tokens, client secrets, certificates, and passwords.
  
An **Azure AD B2C tenant** is the **first resource** you need to create to get started with Azure AD B2C. Learn how in Tutorial: [**Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant**]().

## Accounts in Azure AD B2C
Azure AD B2C defines **several types of user accounts**. Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory **B2B**, and Azure Active Directory **B2C** share these account types.

* **Work account** - Users with work accounts can manage resources in a tenant, and with an **administrator role**, can also manage tenants. Users with work accounts can *create new consumer accounts, reset passwords, block/unblock accounts, and set permissions or assign an account to a security group.*
* **Guest account** - External users you invite to your tenant as guests. A typical scenario for inviting a guest user to your Azure AD B2C tenant **is to share administration responsibilities**.
* **Consumer account** - Consumer accounts are the accounts created in your Azure AD B2C directory when **users complete the sign-up user journey** in an application you've registered in your tenant.

## Consumer accounts
With a consumer account, users can sign in to the applications that you've secured with Azure AD B2C. Users with consumer accounts can't, however, access Azure resources, for example the Azure portal.

A consumer account can be associated with these identity types:

* **Local identity**, with the username and password stored locally in the Azure AD B2C directory. We often refer to these identities as **"local accounts."**
  
* **Social or enterprise identities**, where the identity of the user is managed by a federated identity provider like Facebook, Microsoft, ADFS, or Salesforce.
  
A user with a consumer account can sign in with multiple identities, for example username, email, employee ID, government ID, and others. A single account can have multiple identities, both local and social.

Azure AD B2C lets you manage common attributes of consumer account profiles like **display name, surname, given name, city, and others**. You can also **extend the Azure AD schema** to store additional information about your users. For example, their **country/region** or **residency**, **preferred language**, and **preferences** like whether they want to **subscribe to a newsletter** or **enable multi-factor authentication**.

## External identity providers

You can configure Azure AD B2C to allow users to sign in to your application with credentials from **external social or enterprise identity providers (IdP)**. Azure AD B2C supports external identity providers like **Facebook, Microsoft account, Google, Twitter, and any identity provider** that supports *OAuth 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML* protocols.

![image info](/img/azure/3/external-idps.png)

With external identity provider federation, you can offer your consumers the ability to **sign in with their existing social or enterprise accounts**, *without having to create a new account just for your application.*

On the sign-up or sign-in page, Azure AD B2C presents a list of external identity providers the user can choose for **sign-in**. Once they select one of the external identity providers, they're taken (redirected) to the selected provider's website to complete the sign in process. After the user successfully signs in, they're returned to Azure AD B2C for authentication of the account in your application.

## Identity experiences: user flows or custom policies

The extensible policy framework of Azure AD B2C is its core strength. Policies describe your users' identity experiences such as sign up, sign in, and profile editing.

In Azure AD B2C, there are **two primary paths** you can take to provide these identity experiences: **user flows** and **custom policies**.

* **User flows** are predefined, built-in, configurable policies that we provide so you can create **sign-up, sign-in, and policy editing** experiences in minutes.

* **Custom policies** enable you to create your own user journeys for complex identity experience scenarios.

Both user flows and custom policies are powered by the **Identity Experience Framework, Azure AD B2C's policy orchestration engine.**

## User flow
To help you quickly set up the most common identity tasks, the Azure portal includes several predefined and configurable policies called user flows.

You can configure user flow settings like these to control identity experience behaviors in your applications:

  * Account types used for sign-in, such as social accounts like a Facebook, or local accounts that use an email address and password for sign-in
  * Attributes to be collected from the consumer, such as first name, postal code, or country/region of residency
  * Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  * Customization of the user interface
  * Set of claims in a token that your application receives after the user completes the user flow
  * Session management
  * ...and more.
  
Most common identity scenarios for the majority of mobile, web, and single-page applications can be defined and implemented effectively with user flows. We recommend that you use the built-in user flows unless you have complex user journey scenarios that require the full flexibility of custom policies.

## Custom policy
Custom policies unlock access to the full power of the **Identity Experience Framework (IEF) orchestration engine**. With custom policies, you can leverage IEF to build almost any authentication, user registration, or profile editing experience that you can imagine.

The Identity Experience Framework gives you the ability to construct user journeys with any combination of steps. For example:

* Federate with other identity providers
* First- and third-party multi-factor authentication (MFA) challenges
* Collect any user input
* Integrate with external systems using REST API communication

Each such user journey is defined by a policy, and you can build as many or as few policies as you need to enable the best user experience for your organization.
