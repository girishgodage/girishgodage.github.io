    <h2>Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>In order to create Angular apps, you have to know Typescript. Within thenext few lessons I will teach you its
        basic concepts, by covering the following subjects: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Type annotations</li>
        <li>Arrow functions</li>
        <li>Interfaces</li>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Constructors</li>
        <li>Access modifiers</li>
        <li>Properties</li>
        <li>Modules</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are familiar with these concepts you can skip this tutorial and navigate to the next part, however if you
        are new to TypeScript then follow it carefully.</p>
    <h3>What is TypeScript?</h3>
    <p>At a first glance you might confuse TypeScript with JavaScript. Especially that any valid JavaScript code is also
        a valid TypeScript code, however, it doesn't work another way around. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.

    <blockquote class="blockquote bq-primary">
        <p class="bq-title">Remember:</p>
        <p><strong>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>That means that <strong>TypeScript extends JavaScript with extra functionality</strong> which is not present in
        the current version of JavaScript supported by most browsers. So what are those features? </p>
    <h4>Strong typing</h4>
    <p>If you are familiar with languages like Java or C# you probably know that <strong>each variable requires a type
            and this type has to be declared upfront</strong>. JavaScript is a loosely typed or a dynamically typed
        language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable
        can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:</p>
    <div class="code-toolbar">
        <pre class="code-toolbar language-markup"><code class=" language-markup">var foo = 42;    // foo is now a Number
var foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a String
var foo = true;  // foo is now a Boolean</code></pre>
        
    </div>
    <p>In a weakly typed language, the type of a <strong>value depends on how it is used</strong>. For example, if I can
        pass a string to the addition operator and it will AutoMagically be interpreted as a number <strong>or cause an
            error if the contents of the string cannot be translated into a number</strong>. Similarly, I can
        concatenate strings and numbers or use strings as booleans, etc.</p>
    <p>In a strongly typed language, <strong>a variable has a type and that type cannot change</strong>. What you can do
        to a variable depends on its type. If we try to compile the above code in TypeScript we will get the sfollowing
        error:</p>
    <div class="code-toolbar">
        <pre
            class="code-toolbar language-typescript"><code class=" language-typescript"><span class="token punctuation">[</span>ts<span class="token punctuation">]</span> Subsequent variable declarations must have the same <span class="token keyword">type</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>
Variable <span class="token string">'foo'</span> must be <span class="token keyword">of</span> <span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token string">'number'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> but here has <span class="token keyword">type</span> <span class="token string">'boolean'</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span></code></pre>
        
    </div>
    <p>The advantage of a strongly typed language is that <strong>you are forced to make the behavior of your program
            explicit</strong>. If you want to add a number and a string your code, you must translate the string into a
        number to be used as an operand of the addition operator. <strong>This makes code easier to understand because
            there is no (or less) hidden behavior</strong>. This also makes your code more verbose.</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote bq-primary">
        <p class="bq-title">Remember:</p>
        <p><strong>Strong typing is optional in TypeScript but using this feature makes your application more
                predictable and make it easier to debug so you should definitely make use of it.</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4>Object-oriented</h4>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is an old concept used by multiple languages like Java or C# to help developer
        associate together data and methods within one "object". In <code>OOP</code> object are created and are able to
        interact with each other using one another's public facing methods. <strong>JavaScript itself is not an
            object-oriented language</strong> in the way that C++, C#, or Java are. <strong>TypeScript, on the other
            hand, can be treated as an object-oriented language</strong> because of the language constructs it
        introduces on top of JavaScript closures. </p>
    <p>TypeScript brings many object-oriented features which we missed in JavaScript for a very long time. We have
        explicit concepts of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Interfaces</li>
        <li>Constructors</li>
        <li>Access modifiers (public and private)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will learn all of that in the later sections.</p>
    <h4>Compile-time error</h4>
    <p>Let me explain first what <code>run-time error</code> is as this is a common case. We are talking about the
        <code>run-time error</code> when we face any issue while using our application. In other words â€” if you make a
        mistake when you create your website and write some code, you will see it only while using the
        application/website. For example, if you make a typo in an webpage file your browser console will show you an
        error when you load that page. </p>
    <p>Due to weak typing in JavaScript, it often happens that we try to perform operations on a variable with a
        different type. If our application logic is complex we might not spot that we are trying to assign elements of a
        different type to each other. In JavaScript, we will get to know about the error <strong>only when someone
            triggers code and it fails</strong>. In contrast, TypeScript can provide us with compile-time errors, which
        means, it can spot errors while compiling code to JavaScript, and fix it before deploying to production. Of
        course it won't catch them all, but still a lot.</p>
    <h4>Awesome tool-set</h4>
    <p>I won't write much about this. Along with this course you will see how many useful tools come with Angular.</p>
    <p>Let's don't waste time and start coding!</p>
