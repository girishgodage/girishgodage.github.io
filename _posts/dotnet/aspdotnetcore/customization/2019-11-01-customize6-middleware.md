## Middlewares

Wow, it is already the sixth part of this series. In this chapter I'm going to write about Middlewares and how you can use them to customize your app a little more. I quickly go through the basics about Middlewares and then I'll write about some more special things you can do with Middlewares.

## About Middlewares

The most of you already know what Middlewares are, but some of you maybe not. Even if you already use ASP.NET Core for a while, you don't really need to know details about Middlewares, because they are mostly hidden behind nicely named extension methods like `UseMvc()`, `UseAuthentication()`, `UseDeveloperExceptionPage()` and so on. Every time you call a `Use`-method in the `Startup.cs` in the `Configure` method, you'll implicitly use at least one or maybe more Middlewares.

A middleware is a peace of code that handles the request pipeline. Imagine the request pipeline as huge tube where you can call something in and where an echo comes back. The Middlewares are responsible for the creation of this echo or to manipulate the sound, to enrich the information or to handle the source sound or to handle the echo. 

Middlewares are executed in the order they are configured. The first configured middleware is the first that gets executed.

In an ASP.NET Core web, if the client requests an image or any other static file, the `StaticFileMiddleware` searches for that resource and return that resource if it finds one. If not this middleware does nothing except to call the next one. If there is no last middleware that handles the request pipeline, the request returns nothing. The `MvcMiddleware` also checks the requested resource, tries to map it to a configured route, executes the controller, creates a view and returns a HTML or Web API result. If the `MvcMiddleware` does not find a matching controller, it anyway will return a result in this case it is a 404 Status result. It returns an echo in any case. This is why the `MvcMiddleware` is the last configured middleware.

![](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/index/_static/request-delegate-pipeline.png?view=aspnetcore-2.1)

(Image source: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-2.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-2.1))

An exception handling middleware is usually one of the first configured middlewares, but it is not because it gets executed first, but at last. The first configured middleware is also the last one if the echo comes back from the tube. An exception handling middleware validates the result and displays a possible exception in a browser and client friendly way. This is where a runtime error gets a 500 Status.

You are able to see how the pipeline is executed if you create an empty ASP.NET Core application. I usually use the console and the .NET CLI tools:

```shell
dotnet new web -n MiddlewaresSample -o MiddlewaresSample
cd MiddlewaresSample
```

Open the Startup.cs with your favorite editor. It should be pretty empty compared to a regular ASP.NET Core application. Rewrite the `Configure()` method like this: 

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    // This method gets called by the runtime. 
    // Use this method to add services to the container.
    // For more information on how to configure your application, 
    // visit https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398940
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. 
    // Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }

        app.Run(async context => 
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
        });
    }
}
```

There is the `DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware` used and a special lambda Middleware that only writes "Hello World!" to the response stream. The response stream is the echo I wrote about previously. This special middleware stops the pipeline and returns something like an echo. So it is the last one.

Leave this middleware and add the following lines right before the `app.Run()`:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("===");
    await next();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("===");
});
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(">>>>>> ");
    await next();
    await context.Response.WriteAsync(" <<<<<<");
});
```

These two calls of `app.Use()` also create two lambda Middlewares, but this time the Middlewares are calling the next ones. Each middleware knows the next one and calls it. Both middlewares writing to the response stream before and after the next middleware are called. This should demonstrate how the pipeline works. Before the next middleware is called the actual request is handled and after the next middleware is called, the response (echo) is handled.

If you now run the application (using `dotnet run`) and open the displayed URL in the browser, you should see a plain text result like this:

```text
===>>>>>> Hello World! <<<<<<===
```

Does this make sense to you? If yes, let's see how to use this concept to add some additional functionality to the request pipeline.

## Writing a custom middleware

ASP.NET Core is based on Middlewares. All the logic that gets executed during a request is somehow based on a middleware. So we are able to use this to add custom functionality to the web. We want to know the execution time of every request that goes through the request pipeline. I do this by creating and starting a `Stopwatch` before the next middleware is called and by stop measuring the execution time after the next middleware is called:

```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    var s = new Stopwatch();
    s.Start();
    
    // execute the rest of the pipeline
    await next();
    
    s.Stop(); //stop measuring
    var result = s.ElapsedMilliseconds;
    
    // write out the milliseconds needed
    await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Time needed: {result }");
});
```

After that I write out the elapsed milliseconds to the response stream.

If you write some more Middlewares the `Configure` method in the `Startup.cs` gets pretty messy. This is why the most Middlewares are written as separate classes. This could look like this:

```csharp
public class StopwatchMiddleWare
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public StopwatchMiddleWare(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        var s = new Stopwatch();
        s.Start();

        // execute the rest of the pipeline
        await next();

        s.Stop(); //stop measuring
        var result = s.ElapsedMilliseconds;

        // write out the milliseconds needed
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Time needed: {result }");
    }
}
```

This way we get the next middleware via the constructor and the current context in the `Invoke()` method. 

> Note: The Middleware is initialized on the start of the application and exists once during the application lifetime. The constructor gets called once. On the other hand the Invoke() method is called once per request.

To use this middleware, there is a generic `UseMiddleware()` method available you can use in the configure method:

```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<StopwatchMiddleware>();
```

The more elegant way is to create an extensions method that encapsulates this call:

```csharp
public static class StopwatchMiddlewareExtension
{
    public static IApplicationBuilder UseStopwatch(this IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseMiddleware<StopwatchMiddleware>();
        return app;
    }
}
```

Now you can simply call it like this:

```csharp
app.UseStopwatch();
```

This is the way you can provide additional functionality to a ASP.NET Core web through the request pipeline. You are able to manipulate the request or even the response using Middlewares. 

The `AuthenticationMiddleware` for example tries to request user information from the request. If it doesn't find any, it asked the client about it by sending a specific response back to the client. If it finds some, it adds the information to the request context and makes it available to the entire application this way.

## What else can we do using Middlewares?

Did you know that you can divert the request pipeline into two or more branches?

The next snippet shows how to create branches based on specific paths:

```csharp
app.Map("/map1", app1 =>
{
    // some more Middlewares
    
    app1.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Map Test 1");
    });
});

app.Map("/map2", app2 =>
{
    // some more Middlewares
    
    app2.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Map Test 2");
    });
});

// some more Middlewares

app.Run(async (context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
});

```

The path "/map1" is a specific branch that continues the request pipeline inside. The same with "/map2". Both maps have their own middleware configurations inside. All other not specified paths will follow the main branch.

There is also a `MapWhen()` method to branch the pipeline based on a condition instead of branch based on a path:

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.MapWhen(context => context.Request.Query.ContainsKey("branch"),
                app1 =>
    {
        // some more Middlewares
    
        app1.Run(async context =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("MapBranch Test");
        });
    });

    // some more Middlewares
    
    app.Run(async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello from non-Map delegate. <p>");
    });
}

```

You can create conditions based on configuration values or as shown here, based on properties of the request context. In this case a query string property is used. You can use HTTP headers, form properties or any other property of the request context.

You are also able to nest the maps to create child and grandchild branches if needed.

`Map()` or `MapWhen()` is used to provide a special API or resource based an a specific path or a specific condition. The ASP.NET Core HealthCheck API is done like this. It first uses `MapWhen()` to specify the port to use and then the `Map()` to set the path for the HealthCheck API, or it uses `Map()` only if no port is specified. At the end the HealthCheckMiddleware is used:

```csharp
private static void UseHealthChecksCore(IApplicationBuilder app, PathString path, int? port, object[] args)
{
    if (port == null)
    {
        app.Map(path, b => b.UseMiddleware<HealthCheckMiddleware>(args));
    }
    else
    {
        app.MapWhen(
            c => c.Connection.LocalPort == port,
            b0 => b0.Map(path, b1 => b1.UseMiddleware<HealthCheckMiddleware>(args)));
    }
}

```

> Another question that is Middlewares related, I am not sure why I never seen anyone using IMiddleware instead of writing InvokeAsync manually?!! 

`IMiddleware` is new in ASP.NET Core 2.0 and actually I never knew that it existed before he tweeted about it. I'll definitely have a deeper look into `IMiddleware` and will write about it. Until that you should read Hishams really good post about it: [Why you aren't using IMiddleware?](http://www.hishambinateya.com/why-you-arenot-using-imiddleware)

## Update on ASP.NET Core 3.0

In new ASP.NET Core 3.0 projects the Configure() method looks different. There are two new kind off Middleware elements called:

~~~ csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =>
        {
            await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
        });
    });
}
~~~

The first one is a middleware that uses routing and the other one uses endpoints. What exactly is this?

This is the new so called endpoint routing. In ASP.NET Core 3.0 routing got moved out of the MVC framework. Previously it was part of MVC and only worked with MVC, Web API and frameworks that are based on the MVC Framework. Now MVC and the other frameworks are mapped to a specific route or endpoint. There are different kinds of endpoint definitions available.

In the snippet above a GET request gets mapped to the page root URL. In the next snippet MVC is mapped to a route pattern and Razor Pages are mapped to the razor pages specific file structure based routes:

~~~csharp
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    endpoints.MapRazorPages();
});
~~~

Yes. There is no `UseMvc()` used anymore, even if it still exists and is still working on the `IApplicationBiulder` level to not break existing code. Now there are new methods to activate ASP.NET Core features more granularly.

These are the most used new Map methods for ASP.NET Core 3.0:

~~~csharp
endpoints.MapAreaControllerRoute(...); // Areas for MVC & WebAPI
endpoints.MapControllerRoute(...); // MVC & WebAPI
endpoints.MapBlazorHub(...); // Blazor Server Side
endpoints.MapHub(...); // SignalR
endpoints.MapRazorPages(...); // Razor PAges
endpoints.MapHealthChecks(...); // Health Checks
~~~

There are a lot more methods to define fallback endpoints, to map routes and HTTP methods to delegates and middlewares.

If you want to create middlewares that work on all request, like the `StopWatchMiddleware`, this will work as before on the `IApplicationBuilder`. If you have a Middleware that should work on a specific path or route, you should create a Map method for it to map it to that route. It is not longer recommended to handle the route inside the middleware. With this approach the middlewares are a lot more generic and they will work on multiple routes with a single configuration.

I recently wrote a Middleware to provide a GraphQL endpoint in a ASP.NET Core application. I wrote a Middleware for it and I needed to rewrite it to follow the ASP.NET Core 3.0 way of routing. The old way would still work, but will handle the paths and routes separately from the new ASP.NET Core routing.

Let's quickly see how it looks like to write a Middleware that supports the new endpoint routing:

[TODO: Code]



## Conclusion

Most of the ASP.NET Core features are based on middlewares and we are able to extend ASP.NET Core by creating our own middlewares. 

In the next two chapters I will have a look into different data types and how to handle them. I will create API outputs with any format and data type.
