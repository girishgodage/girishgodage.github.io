        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <h5>Our app is done, however there are still a few more things which we should do:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                change the type of any event properties (i.e. switch time to JS Date instead of string)
            </li>
            <li>
                call an external API to get a real weather forecast
            </li>
            <li>
                add validation to our form (make sure that the user fills in all of the mandatory data)
            </li>
            <li>
                handle duplicates
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>and a few more interesting things. We will learn all about that in Part 2 of our tutorial.&nbsp;</p>
