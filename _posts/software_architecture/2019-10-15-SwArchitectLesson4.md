### Clean And Simple Architecture

Any application that you work on needs to have a very clean and simple architecture. There must be great clarity in the organization on application layers, the use of specific frameworks at each layer, and patterns in communication with external applications. 

### Clear Standards

There needs to be clarity on the sets of standards followed in design, development, deployment and operations. 

### Governance

Architects needs to ensure proper governance around the various standards, and on the creation of common components. In any enterprise application, it always adds great value to have common components that are frequently reused across different applications and application layers. 

### Best Engineering Practices

It is very important to adhere to engineering best practices over the lifetime of an application. Interesting examples are Test Driven Development, Behavior Driven Development, DevOps. Such practices also involve use of consistent build and deployment tools and processes. 

The question you need to ask yourself frequently is - Are you are making the best possible use of these practices, to achieve business goals?

### Awesome Technical Processes

You need to make sure that you have great processes in place for the following:

* Development
* Deployment
* Continuous Integration
* Immediate Defect Feedback

You need to have complete control over such issues.
