            <h2><a id="1"></a>What is Python 2?</h2>
            <p>Python 2 made code development process easier than earlier versions. It implemented technical details of
                Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). Python 2.7 (last version in 2.x ) is no longer under development and
                in 2020 will be discontinued. </p>

            <h2><a id="2"></a>What is Python 3?</h2>
            <p>On December 2008, Python released version 3.0. This version was mainly released to fix problems which
                exist in Python 2. The nature of these change is such that Python 3 was incompatible with Python 2. It
                is <strong>backward incompatible</strong> Some features of Python 3 have been backported to Python 2.x
                versions to make the migration process easy in Python 3. </p>
            <p>As a result, for any organization who was using Python 2.x version, migrating their project to 3.x needed
                lots of changes. These changes not only relate to projects and applications but also all the libraries
                that form part of the Python ecosystem. </p>

            <p>Although, Python 2 is an old open source version here are where you still need to learn Python 2: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>To become a DevOps engineer and you need to work with configurations management tools like puppet or
                    ansible. Here, you need to work with both of these versions. </li>
                <li>If your company's code written in Python 2, you will require to learn to work with that </li>
                <li>If your development team is working on a project that depends on specific third-party libraries or
                    software which you are not able to port to Python 3, then Python 2 is the only option available for
                    you. </li>

            <p>Here, are prime reasons for using Python 3.x versions: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Python 3 supports modern techniques like AI, machine learning, and data science</li>
                <li>Python 3 is supported by a large Python developer's community. Getting support is easy.</li>
                <li>Its easier to learn Python language compared to earlier versions.</li>
                <li>Offers Powerful toolkit and libraries</li>
                <li>Mixable with other languages</li>

            <h2><a id="9"></a>Which Python Version to Use?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to Python version 2 vs. 3 today, Python 3 is the outright winner. That's because Python 2
                won't be available after 2020. Mass Python 3 adoption is the clear direction of the future. </p>
            <p>After considering declining support for Python 2 programming language and added benefits from upgrades to
                Python 3, it is always advisable for a new developer to select Python version 3. However, if a job
                demands Python 2 capabilities, that would be an only compelling reason to use this version. </p>
