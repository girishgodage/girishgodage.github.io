         <h3>What is Tuple in Python?</h3>
         <p>A tuple is just like a list of a sequence of immutable python objects. The difference between list and tuple
            is that list are declared in square brackets and can be changed while <strong>tuple is declared in
               parentheses</strong> and cannot be changed. However, you can take portions of existing tuples to make new
            tuples. </p>
         <p><strong>Tuple Syntax</strong> </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>Tup = ('Jan','feb','march')</code></pre>
         <p>To write an empty tuple, you need to write as two parentheses containing nothing- </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>tup1 = ();</code></pre>
         <p>For writing tuple for a single value, you need to include a comma, even though there is a single value. Also
            at the end you need to write semicolon as shown below. </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>Tup1 = (50,);</code></pre>
         <p>Tuple indices begin at 0, and they can be concatenated, sliced and so on. </p>

         <p><strong>Tuple Assignment </strong> </p>
         <p>Python has tuple assignment feature which enables you to assign more than one variable at a time. In here,
            we have assigned tuple 1 with the persons information like name, surname, birth year, etc. and another tuple
            2 with the values in it like number (1,2,3,â€¦.,7). </p>
         <p>For Example, </p>
         <p> (name, surname, birth year, favorite movie and year, profession, birthplace) = Robert </p>
         <p>Here is the code, </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>tup1 = ('Robert', 'Carlos','1965','Terminator 1995', 'Actor','Florida');
         tup2 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
         print(tup1[0])
         print(tup2[1:4])</code></pre>
         <ul>
            <li>Tuple 1 includes list of information of Robert</li>
            <li>Tuple 2 includes list of numbers in it</li>
            <li>We call the value for [0] in tuple and for tuple 2 we call the value between 1 and 4</li>
            <li>Run the code- It gives name Robert for first tuple while for second tuple it gives number (2,3 and 4)
            </li>
         </ul>
         <h2><a id="1"></a>Packing and Unpacking</h2>
         <p>In packing, we place value into a new tuple while in unpacking we extract those values back into variables.
         </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>x = ("Guru99", 20, "Education")    # tuple packing
         (company, emp, profile) = x    # tuple unpacking
         print(company)
         print(emp)
         print(profile)</code></pre>
         <h2><a id="2"></a>Comparing tuples</h2>
         <p>A comparison operator in Python can work with tuples. </p>
         <p>The comparison starts with a first element of each tuple. If they do not compare to =,&lt; or &gt; then it
            proceed to the second element and so on. </p>
         <p>It starts with comparing the first element from each of the tuples</p>

         <p>Let's study this with an example- </p>
         <p><strong>#case 1</strong> </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>a=(5,6)
         b=(1,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print("a is bigger")
         else: print("b is bigger")
         </code></pre>
         <p><strong>#case 2</strong> </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>a=(5,6)
         b=(5,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print("a is bigger")
         else: print ("b is bigger")</code></pre>
         <p><strong>#case 3</strong> </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>a=(5,6)
         b=(6,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print("a is bigger")
         else: print("b is bigger")</code></pre>
         <p><strong>Case1:</strong> Comparison starts with a first element of each tuple. In this case 5&gt;1, so the
            output a is bigger </p>
         <p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Comparison starts with a first element of each tuple. In this case 5&gt;5 which is
            inconclusive. So it proceeds to the next element. 6&gt;4, so the output a is bigger </p>
         <p><strong>Case 3:</strong> Comparison starts with a first element of each tuple. In this case 5&gt;6 which is
            false. So it goes into the else block and prints "b is bigger." </p>
         <h2><a id="3"></a>Using tuples as keys in dictionaries</h2>
         <p>Since tuples are hashable, and list is not, we must use tuple as the key if we need to create a composite
            key to use in a dictionary. </p>
         <p><strong>Example</strong>: We would come across a composite key if we need to create a telephone directory
            that maps, first-name, last-name, pairs of telephone numbers, etc. Assuming that we have declared the
            variables as last and first number, we could write a dictionary assignment statement as shown below: </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>directory[last,first] = number</code></pre>
         <p>Inside the brackets, the expression is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment in a for loop to navigate this
            dictionary. </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>for last, first in directory:</code></pre>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>    print first, last, directory[last, first]</code></pre>
         <p>This loop navigates the keys in the directory, which are tuples. It assigns the elements of each tuple to
            last and first and then prints the name and corresponding telephone number. </p>
         <p><strong>Tuples and dictionary</strong></p>
         <p>Dictionary can return the list of tuples by calling items, where each tuple is a key value pair. </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>a = {'x':100, 'y':200}
         b = list(a.items())
         print(b) 
         </code></pre>
         <h2><a id="4"></a>Deleting Tuples</h2>
         <p>Tuples are immutable and cannot be deleted. You cannot delete or remove items from a tuple. But deleting
            tuple entirely is possible by using the keyword </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>del</code></pre>
         <h2><a id="5"></a>Slicing of Tuple</h2>
         <p>To fetch specific sets of sub-elements from tuple or list, we use this unique function called slicing.
            Slicing is not only applicable to tuple but also for array and list. </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>x = ("a", "b","c", "d", "e")
         print(x[2:4])</code></pre>
         <p>The output of this code will be ('c', 'd'). </p>
         <p><b>Here is the Python 2 Code for all above example</b> </p>
         <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>tup1 = ('Robert', 'Carlos','1965','Terminator 1995', 'Actor','Florida');
         tup2 = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
         print  tup1[0]
         print  tup2[1:4]
         
         #Packing and Unpacking
         x = ("Guru99", 20, "Education")    # tuple packing
         (company, emp, profile) = x    # tuple unpacking
         print company
         print emp
         print profile
         
         #Comparing tuples
         #case 1
         a=(5,6)
         b=(1,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print "a is bigger"
         else: print "b is bigger"
         
         #case 2
         a=(5,6)
         b=(5,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print "a is bigger"
         else: print "b is bigger"
         
         #case 3
         a=(5,6)
         b=(6,4)
         if (a&gt;b):print "a is bigger"
         else: print "b is bigger"
         
         #Tuples and dictionary
         a = {'x':100, 'y':200}
         b = a.items()
         print b 
         
         #Slicing of Tuple
         x = ("a", "b","c", "d", "e")
         print x[2:4]
         
         </code></pre>
         <h2><a id="6"></a>Built-in functions with Tuple</h2>
         <p>To perform different task, tuple allows you to use many built-in functions like all(), any(), enumerate(),
            max(), min(), sorted(), len(), tuple(), etc. </p>
         <h2><a id="7"></a>Advantages of tuple over list</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Iterating through tuple is faster than with list, since tuples are immutable. </li>
            <li>Tuples that consist of immutable elements can be used as key for dictionary, which is not possible with
               list</li>
            <li>If you have data that is immutable, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains
               write-protected</li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Summary</strong>: </p>
         <p>Python has tuple assignment feature which enables you to assign more than one variable at a time. </p>
