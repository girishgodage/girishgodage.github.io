            <h3>What is Loop?</h3>
            <p>Loops can execute a block of code number of times until a certain condition is met. Their usage is fairly
                common in programming. Unlike other programming language that have For Loop, while loop, dowhile, etc.
            </p>
            <h3>What is For Loop?</h3>
            <p>For loop is used to iterate over elements of a sequence. It is often used when you have a piece of code
                which you want to repeat "n" number of time. </p>
            <p></p>
            <h3>What is While Loop?</h3>
            <p>While Loop is used to repeat a block of code. Instead of running the code block once, It executes the
                code block multiple times until a certain condition is met. </p>

            <h2><a id="1"></a>How to use "While Loop"</h2>
            <p>While loop does the exactly same thing what "if statement" does, but instead of running the code block
                once, they jump back to the point where it began the code and repeats the whole process again. </p>
            <p>Syntax </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>while expression
          Statement  
         </code></pre>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         #
         #Example file for working with loops
         #
         def main():
             x=0
             #define a while loop
             while(x &lt;4):
                 print(x)
                 x = x+1
         
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Code Line 4: Variable x is set to 0</li>
                <li>Code Line 7: While loop checks for condition x&lt;4. The current value of x is 0. Condition is true.
                    Flow of control enters into while Loop</li>
                <li>Code Line 8: Value of x is printed</li>
                <li>Code Line 9: x is incremented by 1. Flow of control goes back to line 7. Now the value of x is 1
                    which is less than 4. The condition is true, and again the while loop is executed. This continues
                    till x becomes 4, and the while condition becomes false.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a id="2"></a>How to use "For Loop"</h2>
            <p>In Python, "for loops" are called <strong>iterators.</strong></p>
            <p>Just like while loop, "For Loop" is also used to repeat the program. </p>
            <p>But unlike while loop which depends on condition true or false. "For Loop" depends on the elements it has
                to iterate. </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         #
         #Example file for working with loops
         #
         def main():
             x=0
             #define a while loop
         #	while(x &lt;4):
         #		print x
         #		x = x+1
         
         
             #Define a for loop 
         for x in range(2,7):
                 print(x)
         
         
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <p>For Loop iterates with number declared in the range. </p>
            <p>For example, </p>
            <p><strong>For Loop</strong> for x in range (2,7) </p>
            <p>When this code is executed, it will print the number between 2 and 7 (2,3,4,5,6). In this code, number 7
                is not considered inside the range. </p>
            <p>For Loops can also be used for a set of other things and not just number. We will see thin in next
                section. </p>
            <h2><a id="3"></a>How to use For Loop for String </h2>
            <p>In this step, we will see how "for loops" can also be used for other things besides numbers. </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         def main():
             #use a for loop over a collection
             Months = ["Jan","Feb","Mar","April","May","June"]
             for m in Months:
                 print(m)
                 
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <p>Code Line 3: We store the months ("Jan, Feb , Mar,April,May,June") in variable Months </p>
            <p>Code Line 4: We iterate the for loop over each value in Months. The current value of Months in stored in
                variable m</p>

            <p>Code Line 5: Print the month </p>
            <h2><a id="4"></a>How to use break statements in For Loop</h2>
            <p>Breakpoint is a unique function in For Loop that allows you to break or terminate the execution of the
                for loop </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         def main():
             #use a for loop over a collection
             #Months = ["Jan","Feb","Mar","April","May","June"]
             #for m in Months:
                 #print m
                 
         # use the break and continue statements
                 
                 
                 for x in range (10,20):
                     if (x == 15): break
                     #if (x % 2 == 0) : continue
                     print(x)
         
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <p>In this example, we declared the numbers from 10-20, but we want that our for loop to terminate at number 15
            and stop executing further. For that, we declare break function by defining (x==15): break, so as soon as
            the code calls the number 15 it terminates the program Code Line 10 declare variable x between range (10,
            20)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code Line 11 declare the condition for breakpoint at x==15,</li>
                <li>Code Line 12 checks and repeats the steps until it reaches number 15</li>
                <li>Code Line 13 Print the result in output </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a id="5"></a>How to use "continue statement" in For Loop</h2>
            <p>Continue function, as the name indicates, will terminate the current iteration of the for loop BUT will
                continue execution of the remaining iterations. </p>
            <p><strong>Example</strong> </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         def main():
             #use a for loop over a collection
             #Months = ["Jan","Feb","Mar","April","May","June"]
             #for m in Months:
                 #print m
                 
         # use the break and continue statements
                 
                 
                 for x in range (10,20):
                     #if (x == 15): break
                     if (x % 5 == 0) : continue
                     print(x)
         
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <p>Continue statement can be used in for loop when you want to fetch a specific value from the list. </p>
            <p>In our example, we have declared value 10-20, but between these numbers we only want those number that
                are NOT divisible by 5 or in other words which don't give zero when divided by 5. </p>
            <p> So, in our range (10,11, 12….19,20) only 3 numbers falls (10,15,20) that are divisible by 5 and rest are
                not. </p>
            <p>So except number 10,15 &amp; 20 the "for loop" will not continue and print out those number as output.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code line 10 declare the variable x for range (10, 20)</li>
                <li>Code line 12 declare the condition for x divided by 5=0 continue</li>
                <li>Code line 13 print the result </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a id="6"></a>How to use "enumerate" function for "For Loop"</h2>
            <p>Enumerate function in "for loop" does two things </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It returns the index number for the member </li>
                <li>And the member of the collection that we are looking at</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example</strong>: </p>
            <p>Enumerate function is used for the numbering or indexing the members in the list. </p>
            <p>Suppose, we want to do numbering for our month ( Jan, Feb, Marc, ….June), so we declare the variable i
                that enumerate the numbers while m will print the number of month in list. </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>
         def main():
             #use a for loop over a collection
             Months = ["Jan","Feb","Mar","April","May","June"]
             for i, m in enumerate (Months):
                 print(i,m)
                 
         # use the break and continue statements
                 
                 
                 #for x in range (10,20):
                 #if (x == 15): break
                 #if (x % 5 == 0) : continue
                 #print x
         
         
                 
         if __name__ == "__main__":
             main()</code></pre>
            <p>When code is executed the output of the enumerate function returns the months name with an index number
                like (0-Jan), (1- Feb), (2- March), etc. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code Line 3 declares the list of months [ Jan, Feb,…Jun]</li>
                <li>Code Line 4 declares variable i and m for For Loop </li>
                <li>Code Line 5 will print the result and again enter the For Loop for the rest of the months to
                    enumerate</li>

            <h2><a id="7"></a>How to use for loop to repeat the same statement over and again</h2>
            <p>You can use for loop for even repeating the same statement over and again. Here in the example we have
                printed out word "guru99" three times. </p>
            <p>Example: To repeat same statement number of times, we have declared the number in variable i (i in 123).
                So when you run the code as shown below, it prints the statement (guru99) that many times the number
                declared for our the variable in ( i in 123). </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar"><code>for i in '123':
          print "guru99",i,</code></pre>
            <p>Like other programming languages, Python also uses a loop but instead of using a range of different loops
                it is restricted to only two loops "While loop" and "for loop". </p>
            <ul>
                <li>While loops are executed based on whether the conditional statement is true or false.</li>
                <li>For loops are called iterators, it iterates the element based on the condition set</li>
                <li>Python For loops can also be used for a set of various other things (specifying the collection of
                    elements we want to loop over)</li>
                <li>Breakpoint is used in For Loop to break or terminate the program at any particular point</li>
                <li>Continue statement will continue to print out the statement, and prints out the result as per the
                    condition set</li>
                <li>Enumerate function in "for loop" returns the member of the collection that we are looking at with
                    the index number</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Python 2 Example</b> </p>
            <p>Above codes are Python 3 examples, If you want to run in Python 2 please consider following code. </p>
