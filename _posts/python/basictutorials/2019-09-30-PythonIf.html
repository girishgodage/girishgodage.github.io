            <h3>What are Conditional Statements?</h3>
            <p>Conditional Statement in Python perform different computations or actions depending on whether a specific
                Boolean constraint evaluates to true or false. Conditional statements are handled by IF statements in
                Python. </p>
            <p>In this tutorial, we will see how to apply conditional statements in Python. </p>

            <h2><a id="1"></a>What is If Statement? How to Use it?</h2>
            <p>In Python, If Statement is used for decision making. It will run the body of code only when IF statement
                is true. </p>
            <p>When you want to justify one condition while the other condition is not true, then you use "if
                statement". </p>

                    <p>The "else condition" is usually used when you have to judge one statement on the basis of other.
                        If one condition goes wrong, then there should be another condition that should justify the
                        statement or logic. </p>

            <h2><a id="4"></a>When "else condition" does not work</h2>
            <p>There might be many instances when your "else condition" won't give you the desired result. It will print
                out the wrong result as there is a mistake in program logic. In most cases, this happens when you have
                to justify more than two statement or condition in a program. </p>
            <p> An <strong>example</strong> will better help you to understand this concept. </p>
            <p>Here both the variables are same (8,8) and the program output is <strong>"x is greater than y",</strong>
                which is <strong>WRONG</strong>. This is because it checks the first condition (if condition), and if it
                fails, then it prints out the second condition (else condition) as default. In next step, we will see
                how we can correct this error.</p>

            <h2><a id="5"></a>How to use "elif" condition</h2>
            <p>To correct the previous error made by "else condition", we can use <strong>"elif"</strong> statement. By
                using "<strong>elif</strong>" condition, you are telling the program to print out the third condition or
                possibility when the other condition goes wrong or incorrect. </p>

                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p>A conditional statement in Python is handled by if statements and we saw various other ways we
                        can use conditional statements like if and else over here. </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> "if condition" – It is used when you need to print out the result when one of the
                            conditions is true or false.</li>
                        <li> "else condition"- it is used when you want to print out the statement when your one
                            condition fails to meet the requirement</li>
                        <li> "elif condition" – It is used when you have third possibility as the outcome. You can use
                            multiple elif conditions to check for 4<sup>th</sup>,5<sup>th</sup>,6<sup>th</sup>
                            possibilities in your code</li>
                        <li>We can use minimal code to execute conditional statements by declaring all condition in
                            single statement to run the code </li>
                        <li>If Statement can be nested</li>
                    </ul>
