        </div>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">

            <p>Calendar module in Python has the calendar class that allows the calculations for various task based on
                date, month, and year. On top of it, the TextCalendar and HTMLCalendar class in Python allows you to
                edit the calendar and use as per your requirement. </p>
            <p>Let see what we can do with Python Calendar. </p>
            <p><strong>Step1)</strong> Run the code. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.1.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.1.png"></a> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code Line # 1: We begin with "import calendar" which will import all the classes of this module.
                </li>
                <li>Code Line # 3: c= calendar.TextCalendar(calendar.SUNDAY) tells the interpreter to create a text
                    calendar. Start of the month will be Sunday. In Python, you can format the calendar as you can
                    change the day of the month to begin with</li>
                <li>Code Line # 4: str= c.formatmonth(2025,1) We are creating calendar for the year 2025, Month 1 â€“
                    January</li>
                <li>Code Line # 5: print str will print the output.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's quickly change the value from Sunday to Thursday and check the output </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.2.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.2.png"></a> </p>
            <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> You can also print out the Calendar in HTML format, this feature is helpful for
                developer if they want to make any changes in the look and feel of calendar </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.3.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.3.png"></a> </p>
            <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Loops over the days of a month by using c.itermonthday (2025,4), it will fetch
                the total number of days for that month.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.4.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.4.png"></a> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you execute the code to get the total number of days for a specific month say "April" then you
                    will get 30 days in the output but you will also see some zeros along with these days at the
                    beginning and sometimes at the end of it. </li>
                <li>Zeros in the output mean that the day of the week is in an overlapping month, which means it does
                    not belong to that month.</li>
                <li>These zeros appears in output because, in your code you have mentioned day (Thursday), so when you
                    call function "c.itermonthdays", it will start counting days from Thursday and your Thursday may not
                    start with date 1<sup>st</sup> of April it might be 28<sup>th </sup>or 29<sup>th</sup> of March, so
                    when you execute the code it will start counting days from 28<sup>th</sup> of march and any days
                    after that till 1<sup>st</sup> of April. These days will be counted as zero and in the output you
                    will see these zeroes and same is applicable to the end of the month.</li>
                <li>So except date 1-30 all the dates from previous as well as post month will appear in the output as
                    zeroes. </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 4)</strong> You can fetch the data from the local system, like months or weekdays, etc </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.5.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.5.png"></a> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The output over here shows that we have printed out the months name from the local system. Likewise,
                    you can also fetch the weekdays name as shown below</li>
                <li>
                    <div>The output will depend on the local system, suppose if your local system is some other
                        countries then it will give the output as per the local settings of that country. Here we have
                        months so it won't be a difference but if it is a week or day, it will certainly differ.</div>
                    <p> </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.6.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.6.png"></a> </p>
            <p><strong>Step 5)</strong> You can fetch the list of the specific day for a whole year. For example, there
                is an audit day on every first Monday of a week. You want to know the date of first Monday for each
                month. You can use this code</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.7.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img title="Calendar in Python"
                        alt="Python CALENDAR Tutorial with Example" src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/18/Python16.7.png"></a> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>mycal = calendar.monthcalendar(2025, month) will create calendar for the month</li>
                <li>Set variables week1 and week2 to the First and second week of the calendar</li>
                <li>Check if Week 1 contains Monday, set audit day</li>
                <li>Else set audit day as the first Monday in week 2</li>
                <li>The output shows the date for the first Monday that falls in that month. </li>
                <li>The length of this Cal object is going to be a certain length, based on how many weeks there in the
                    month. In our case, it's going to be one or two as such first Monday of the week will be in the
                    first week most often but if not then consider the second week. Let see in detail why we also
                    consider the second week.</li>
                <li>Here we are using the calendar's constant Monday, the calendar object gives you constants that
                    represent Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, so on, so forth. We've seen these previously. So, if in week one
                    the day represented by the Monday constant is not equal to 0, remember zeros means days that belong
                    to another month. So, in this case, if it's zero, it's going to be a Monday that belongs to the
                    previous month. But if the first Monday is not equal to 0, that means that my audit day will be
                    within the week one. Otherwise, if that is 0, then the first Monday isn't in the first week of the
                    month, it's gotta be in the second. </li>
                <li>So, then I say okay, set my audit day variable to be the Monday represented by Week two. So, audit
                    day is going to come back with whatever the day is for either the first or second week. </li>
            </ul>
