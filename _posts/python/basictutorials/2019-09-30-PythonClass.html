            <h3>What is a Class?</h3>
            <p>A Class is a logical grouping of data and functions. It gives the freedom to create data structures that
                contains arbitrary content and hence easily accessible. </p>
            <p>For example, for any bank employee who want to fetch the customer details online would go to
                <strong>customer class</strong>, where all its attributes like transaction details, withdrawal and
                deposit details, outstanding debt, etc. would be listed out. </p>
            <p>In this tutorial, we will learn, </p>

            <h2><a id="2"></a>How to define Python classes</h2>
            <p>To define class you need to consider following points</p>
            <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> In Python, classes are defined by the <strong>"Class" </strong>keyword </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         class myClass():
             </pre>
            <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Inside classes, you can define functions or methods that are part of this class
            </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         def method1 (self):
            print "Guru99"
         def method2 (self,someString): 
            print "Software Testing:" + someString
         </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Here we have defined method1 that prints "Guru99."</li>
                <li>Another method we have defined is method2 that prints "Software Testing"+ SomeString. SomeString is
                    the variable supplied by the calling method</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Everything in a class is indented, just like the code in the function, loop, if
                statement, etc. Anything not indented is not in the class </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/15/071515_1030_PythonClass1.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img
                        title="Python Class &amp; Objects: Object Oriented Programming (OOP’s)"
                        alt="Python Class &amp; Objects: Define Class, Inheritance - OOP Tutorial"
                        src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/15/071515_1030_PythonClass1.png"></a> </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: About using "self" in Python </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The self-argument refers to the object itself. Hence the use of the word self. So inside this
                    method, self will refer to the specific instance of this object that's being operated on.</li>
                <li>Self is the name preferred by convention by Pythons to indicate the first parameter of instance
                    methods in Python. It is part of the Python syntax to access members of objects</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 4)</strong> To make an object of the class </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         c = myClass()
         </pre>
            <p><strong>Step 5)</strong> To call a method in a class </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">    c.method1()
             c.method2(" Testing is fun")
         </pre>
            <ul>
                <li>Notice that when we call the method1 or method2, we don't have to supply the self-keyword. That's
                    automatically handled for us by the Python runtime. </li>
                <li>Python runtime will pass "self" value when you call an instance method on in instance, whether you
                    provide it deliberately or not</li>
                <li>You just have to care about the non-self arguments</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Step 6) </strong>Here is the complete code </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         # Example file for working with classes
         class myClass():
           def method1(self):
               print("Guru99")
                 
           def method2(self,someString):    
               print("Software Testing:" + someString)
           
               
         def main():           
           # exercise the class methods
           c = myClass ()
           c.method1()
           c.method2(" Testing is fun")
           
         if __name__== "__main__":
           main()</pre>
            <h2><a id="3"></a>How Inheritance works</h2>
            <p>Inheritance is a feature used in object-oriented programming; it refers to defining a new class with less
                or no modification to an existing class. The new class is called <strong>derived class</strong> and from
                one which it inherits is called the <strong>base</strong>. Python supports inheritance; it also supports
                <strong>multiple inheritances</strong>. A class can inherit attributes and behavior methods from another
                class called subclass or heir class. </p>
            <p style="text-align: center; "><a href="/{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/15/071515_1030_PythonClass2.png"
                    class="jh-image-popup-colorbox cboxElement"><img
                        title="Python Class &amp; Objects: Object Oriented Programming (OOP’s)"

                        src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/img/python/tutorial/15//071515_1030_PythonClass2.png"></a> </p>

            <p><strong>Python Inheritance Syntax</strong> </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
             body_of_derived_class
         </pre>
            <p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Run the following code </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         # Example file for working with classes
         class myClass():
           def method1(self):
               print("Guru99")
                 
           
         class childClass(myClass):
           #def method1(self):
                 #myClass.method1(self);
                 #print ("childClass Method1")
                 
           def method2(self):
                 print("childClass method2")     
                  
         def main():           
           # exercise the class methods
           c2 = childClass()
           c2.method1()
           #c2.method2()
         
         if __name__== "__main__":
           main()
         </pre>
            <p>Notice that the in childClass, method1 is not defined but it is derived from the parent myClass. The
                output is "Guru99." </p>
            <p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Uncomment Line # 8 &amp; 10. Run the code </p>
            <p>Now, the method 1 is defined in the childClass and output "childClass Method1" is correctly shown. </p>
            <p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Uncomment Line #9. Run the code </p>
            <p>You can a method of the parent class using the syntax </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">	ParentClassName.MethodName(self)
         </pre>
            <p>In our case, we call, myClass.method1(self) and Guru99 is printed as expected </p>
            <p><strong>Step 4</strong>) Uncomment Line #19. Run the code. </p>
            <p>Method 2 of the child class is called and "childClass method2" is printed as expected.</p>

            <h2><a id="4"></a>Python Constructors</h2>
            <p>A constructor is a class function that instantiates an object to predefined values. </p>
            <p>It begins with a double underscore (_). It __init__() method </p>
            <p>In below example we are taking name of the user using constructor. </p>
            <pre class="code-toolbar">
         class User:
             name = ""
         
             def __init__(self, name):
                 self.name = name
         
             def sayHello(self):
                 print("Welcome to Guru99, " + self.name)
         
         User1 = User("Alex")
         User1.sayHello()
         </pre>
